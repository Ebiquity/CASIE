{"content": "In the past weeks, information-stealing malware EyePyramid made headlines after it was used to steal 87GB of sensitive data from government offices, private companies and public organizations. More than 100 email domains and 18,000 email accounts were targeted, including those of high-profile victims in Italy, the U.S., Japan and Europe. The natural assumption for many would be that EyePyramid was a state-sponsored cyberespionage campaign. It was ultimately attributed to a brother-sister team who used the malware for profit. Playing Whodunit is Hard If there\u2019s anything EyePyramid can valuably teach us, it\u2019s that playing whodunit is hard. Attribution is one of the most complicated aspects in cybersecurity. It\u2019s partly because of the Internet\u2019s underlying architecture and the many ways perpetrators can cover their tracks. While we can attribute cyberattacks to certain threat actors, most threat researchers and information security professionals are cautious and often avoid attributing them to a specific person, group, or country.", "sourcefile": "443.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 95, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 100, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "In the past weeks", "endOffset": 17, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "government offices", "endOffset": 147, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 129, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "sensitive data", "endOffset": 123, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 109, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "87GB", "endOffset": 105, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Data"}, "startOffset": 101, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "EyePyramid", "endOffset": 58, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 48, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "it", "endOffset": 82, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 80, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "public organizations", "endOffset": 191, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 171, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "private companies", "endOffset": 166, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 149, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "EyePyramid and a Lesson on the Perils of Attribution - TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog", "date": "2017_01_31", "type": "text", "link": "http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/eyepyramid-lesson-perils-attribution/"}}
