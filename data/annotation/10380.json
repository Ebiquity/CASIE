{"content": "Most CISOs like a challenge. Matthew Maglieri faced more than a challenge when he agreed to become the chief information security officer for Ruby Life Inc., parent of the Toronto-based Ashley Madison and other dating sites which in 2015 saw hackers release records of some 36 million members, plus application code and corporate email. Even Maglieri says the company suffered a \u201ctremendous loss of consumer trust,\u201d and \u201cusers relied on discretion using the service, and that discretion was violated.\u201d When he tried recruiting security staff this year a number balked when hearing who their employer would be. In fact, he admitted Wednesday at the monthly meeting of the Toronto Area Security Klatch (TASK), a group of infosec pros and students, that a headhunter he consulted flatly told him to decline the offer. \u201cAbsolutely not, your personal brand is at stake,\u201d he recalled being told. And that\u2019s why he said yes. \u201cI thought about it \u2018If I don\u2019t do this there isn\u2019t going to be anybody fighting for the users,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to dive in and take on the challenge.\u201d Now the company is recovering, Maglieri says, because it is signing up 550,000 users a month. He didn\u2019t say if the overall number of users is down from the breach, which captured headlines around the world. The Ashley Madison site claims over 56 million members have joined since 2002. Maglieri explained over some 60 minutes how Ruby Life has tried to build a leading data privacy and information security program to regain trust. That includes having a full-time red team for penetration testing, building a \u201chypersegmented network,\u201d extensive use of multi-factor authentication on the corporate servers to limit outside access by stolen credentials, decentralized and segmented directory services for employee login, controls to prevent lateral movement through the network, advanced threat detection and an around-the-clock security operations centre run by a consulting firm. Former federal interim privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier was hired at the end of 2016 as special privacy advisor to guide the privacy remediation program \u201cto the next level.\u201d It also includes a mission statement Maglieri drafted, saying his goal is \u201cto build a leading intelligence-led threat-based program capable of defending against the most advanced threats.\u201d Asked in an interview if after nine months that has been achieved, he replied, \u201cThe thing about mission statements is they\u2019re objectives, and as a security professional [would say], it\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s about risk management and I think we\u2019re doing some things we\u2019re proud of, we\u2019re making significant progress, and we\u2019re continuously pushing forward.\u201d Attackers come up with new techniques, he added, and his team has to get better as defenders. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant process.\u201d While he wants a resilient secure environment \u201cto prevent something like this happening again,\u201d he admitted that as a company that runs several dating sites, we \u201cwill remain a very high profile target.\u201d The company wants to take privacy \u201cto the next level,\u201d Maglieri says. While there is no obligation for users to register with their real names or occupations he did describe the alleged occupations of users and why the company will continue to be a target, particularly for nation states looking for evidence for blackmail. \u201dThe Ashley Madison user base spans a cross-section of society \u2013 there\u2019s police, military, government, research, medical, corporate, education \u2014 you name it, those people are in there. These are people that could be targets, and data that could be used to target those individuals.\u201d As a result, he said, the company now has \u201czero risk tolerance\u201d for security and privacy problems.", "sourcefile": "10380.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 250, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 257, "text": "release"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 249, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 242, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "2015", "endOffset": 237, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 233, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "records", "endOffset": 265, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 258, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "36 million", "endOffset": 284, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 274, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "members", "endOffset": 292, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 285, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "application code", "endOffset": 315, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 299, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "corporate email", "endOffset": 335, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 320, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "dating sites", "endOffset": 223, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 211, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q43788"}, "endOffset": 200, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Madison", "startOffset": 193, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Ashley Madison\u2019s new security head seeks redemption", "date": "2017_10_26", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/ashley-madisons-new-security-head-seeks-redemption/398056"}}
