{"content": "Buzz60 A view of the Kremlin in Moscow on Jan. 6, 2017. Russia's alleged\u00a0use of computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade. Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France\u00a0and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Russian hackers\u00a0appeared\u00a0aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that included\u00a0government\u00a0agencies, the media and elected officials. Those investigations bolster U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling to help elect Donald Trump, a conclusion the president-elect has\u00a0disputed \u2014 although he conceded Friday after a private intelligence briefing that Russia was among the possible hacking culprits. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very good at using the West\u2019s weaknesses against itself, the open Internet to hack, the free media to sow discord, and to cause people to question the underpinnings of the systems under which they live,\u201d said Hannah Thoburn, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee Thursday that Russian intelligence hackers, masquerading as third parties, have\u00a0conducted attacks abroad that\u00a0targeted\u00a0critical infrastructure networks. \u201cRussia also has used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia,\u201d Clapper said. A declassified intelligence report on the Russian hacking released Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering the effort to help elect Trump. It warned that Russia would use lessons learned from the effort to disrupt elections of U.S. allies. USA TODAY Intel chiefs: We're certain that Russia tried to influence U.S. election In 2007, Putin told the Munich Security Conference that the United States\u2019 effort to spread its form of democracy was an insidious threat to Russia and other nations and that his government would push back. Russian sabotage of Western computer systems started that same year. In 2007, Estonia\u00a0accused hackers using Russian IP addresses of a wide-scale denial of service attack that shut down the Internet in the former Soviet republic and one of NATO\u2019s newest members. According to The Guardian\u00a0newspaper, the attacks came in waves that coincided with riots on May 3, 2007, over the statue, whose removal drew objections from Russia and Russian-speaking Estonians, and on May 8 and 9, when Russia celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany. They\u00a0blamed the attacks on a pro-Russia group called CyberBerkut. Hudson analyst Thoburn, who was working as an election observer in Ukraine at the time, said the Ukrainians were able to get around it by deleting\u00a0their entire system and restoring it from a backup that was not contaminated. Ukrainian officials have also accused Russia of being behind a power grid attack in December 2015 that cut power to 80,000 in western Ukraine. In overt actions against Ukraine, Russia seized the province of Crimea in 2014 and helped armed separatists launch a rebellion in eastern Ukraine. German intelligence in 2015 accused Russia of hacking at least 15 computers belonging to members of Germany\u2019s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and stealing data. Germany\u2019s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said the attack was conducted by a group called Sofacy, which \u201cis being steered by the Russian state.\" BfV chief Hans-Georg Maassen told Reuters in November that Moscow has tried to manipulate the media and public opinion through various means, including planting false stories. One\u00a0in 2015 by Russian media was about a German-Russian girl kidnapped and raped by migrants in Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could not rule out Russian interference\u00a0in Germany's 2017\u00a0federal election through Internet attacks and disinformation campaigns. The country's Central Election Commission had been hacked during a referendum and local elections in 2015\u00a0that was almost certainly linked to Russia\u00a0and a group that had hacked NATO headquarters in Brussels in 2013,\u00a0then-President Rosen Plevneliev told the BBC in November. \"The same organization that has attacked the (German Parliament)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stealing all the emails of German members of Parliament \u2014\u00a0the same institution that has attacked NATO headquarters, and that is the same even that has tried to influence American elections lately and so in a very high probability you could point east from us\u201d (to Moscow), Plevneliev said. A pro-Russian political novice was elected in November to replace Plevneliev. The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose tasks include\u00a0monitoring\u00a0elections across Europe and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, was attacked in \u201ca major information security incident\u201d in November, spokeswoman Mersiha Causevic Podzic said. The incident\u00a0\u201ccompromised the confidentiality\u201d of the organization\u2019s IT networks, Podzic said. The French daily Le Monde, which first reported the incident, cited a Western intelligence agency attributing the attack to the Russia-linked group APT28, aka Fancy Bear, and Sofacy. Russia,\u00a0a member of the OSCE, has objected to the group\u2019s criticism of Russian-backed forces battling the Ukrainian government\u00a0in eastern Ukraine. Russian hackers posing as the \u201cCyber Caliphate\u201d were suspected of attacking France\u2019s TV5Monde television channel in 2014, causing extensive damage to the company\u2019s computer systems, FireEye, a cyber security firm that examined the attack, told BuzzFeed. The attack\u00a0involved posting of Islamic State propaganda, but appeared to use the same servers and have other similarities with Russian-linked APT28, the group that is a suspect in attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the OSCE and several other European countries. \u201cAPT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government,\u201d FireEye said. \u201cSpecifically, since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government\u201d. The security chief of France's ruling Socialist Party recently warned that the country's presidential election this spring is at risk of being hacked. Hackers in 2014 attacked the Warsaw Stock Exchange and at least 36 other Polish sites, stealing data and posting graphic images from the Holocaust. The group that claimed responsibility, CyberBerkut, is the same Russian-linked group that attacked Ukrainian sites. The group, posing as Islamic radicals, stole data and released dozens of client log-in data, causing mayhem for the exchange, according to Bloomberg News. Dan Wallach, a computer scientist at Rice University who testified about election computer security on Capitol Hill in September, said definitive proof of who conducted an attack would reveal methods and sources who would be lost or killed if\u00a0exposed. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to have definitive attribution,\u201d Wallach said in an interview. \u201cThe proof is some crazy top secret thing and not for public dissemination\u201d.", "sourcefile": "141.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E12", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual",
