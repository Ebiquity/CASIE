{"content": "Bad\u00a0as\u00a0Cloudbleed is, there\u2019s no evidence attackers exploited it before the patch was deployed. But since the vulnerability was triggered more than 1.2m times from 6,500 sites, Cloudflare is taking no\u00a0chances: the company has tapped an outside company,\u00a0Veracode, to scour its code. CEO Matthew Prince pledged the external review as he set out a detailed update after 12 days of investigation. That update includes a synopsis of how the vulnerability was created and who faced the most risk. He said Cloudflare continues to work with Google and others to eliminate all\u00a0leaked data from memory: We\u2019ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages. That underestimates the total number because we\u2019ve requested search engines purge and re-crawl entire sites in some instances. Cloudbleed is a serious\u00a0vulnerability in Cloudflare\u2019s internet infrastructure that\u00a0Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered in mid-February. It turned out that\u00a0a single character in Cloudflare\u2019s code caused\u00a0the problem. In its initial blog post on the matter, Cloudflare said\u00a0the issue stemmed from its\u00a0decision to use a new HTML parser called cf-html. In his update, Prince said Cloudbleed was triggered when a page with two characteristics was requested through Cloudflare\u2019s network", "sourcefile": "874.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 52, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 61, "text": "exploited"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "attackers", "endOffset": 51, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 42, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "Cloudbleed", "endOffset": 17, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 7, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 913, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 923, "text": "discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "Cloudbleed", "endOffset": 795, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 785, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "a serious\u00a0vulnerability", "endOffset": 822, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 799, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "internet infrastructure", "endOffset": 862, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 839, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy", "endOffset": 912, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 868, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "mid-February", "endOffset": 939, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 927, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloudflare", "wikidataid": "Q4778915"}, "endOffset": 836, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "text": "Cloudflare", "startOffset": 826, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 82, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 94, "text": "was deployed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "the patch", "endOffset": 81, "role": {"type": "Patch"}, "startOffset": 72, "type": "Patch"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Cloudflare chief pledges third-party review of code \u2013 Naked Security", "date": "2017_03_03", "type": "text", "link": "https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/03/02/cloudflare-chief-pledges-third-party-review-of-code/?utm_source=Naked+Security+-+Sophos+List&utm_campaign=cd410ebc90-naked%252Bsecurity&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_31623bb782-cd410ebc90-455160889"}}
