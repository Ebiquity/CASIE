{"content": "The Managing Director of a company held to ransom by hackers has warned other bosses to protect themselves against cyber crooks \u2212 or run the risk of web sharks crippling their businesses. Stuart Kettell \u2212 owner of audio-visual specialist Kettell Video Productions \u2212 was targeted by tech scammers who infiltrated his firm\u2019s IT systems with malware that infected its network of files. They demanded \u00a31,000 initially in Bitcoins to decrypt the malicious software \u2212 and warned that failure to pay would render the files permanently inaccessible. Thankfully Stuart routinely backs-up all company systems \u2212 and even backs up the back-ups \u2212 so survived the online attack relatively unscathed. But he\u2019s warned that without the archive of replicas his entire business could have collapsed. He said: \u201cI noticed all my photos, videos and pdf files ghosting to white with a new filename\u2026it attacked my desktop first then it wormed its way into folders one file at a time every few seconds.  \u201cI\u2019ve no idea how the malware was introduced as we use software that\u2019s designed to prevent against such attacks. And the demand for payment seemed very professional: I was given links where I could buy Bitcoins and even offered the chance to decrypt one file for free!  \u201cI unplugged my computer, isolated it from the internet, and ran some anti-malware software to stop the virus spreading further.  \u201cIt was scary: I had no idea about cyber-attacks before and really didn\u2019t know what to do. Critical files, including images and videos for clients, were wiped out along with a lifetime of personal memories. \u201cThe affected files were lost for good \u2212 the only way to recover them was with the key code held by the blackmailer \u2212 but luckily I back-up everything to an external data cartridge. In the end it was more an inconvenience\u2026but it could have threatened the business. \u201cI would strongly urge all business owners to back-up their essential files.\" Sergeant Gary Sirrell from the cybercrime team at West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit said commercial web attacks are increasingly being committed against smaller firms and not big multi-nationals. He explained: \u201cSmall and medium sized companies are easier targets: they often don\u2019t have the resources or expertise to protect against cyberattacks. And if they are targeted, the impact can be devastating.  \u201cBut there are steps business owners can take to mitigate the risk. A really effective tactic involves \u2018layering\u2019 defences to include a firewall, anti-malware software, staff training and regular re-training) around phishing email awareness, and finally to plug any holes in your defences by updating software patches and updates in a timely manner. \u201cBy exercising good cyber hygiene, and having a strong backup policy, Stuart avoided the dilemma of whether to see his business significantly damaged, or to have to hand over a ransom to organised crime gangs to get his data unlocked.  \u201cIf more businesses in the West Midlands proactively took such steps there would be significantly fewer crimes victims.\" ", "sourcefile": "10059.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 36, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 50, "text": "held to ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 61, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 54, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "a company", "endOffset": 35, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 26, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "The Managing Director", "endOffset": 22, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "cyber crooks", "endOffset": 128, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 116, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 389, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 397, "text": "demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "They", "endOffset": 388, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 384, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Bitcoins", "endOffset": 426, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 418, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "\u00a31,000", "endOffset": 404, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 398, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "malicious software", "endOffset": 460, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 442, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T20", "text": "infiltrated his firm\u2019s IT systems", "endOffset": 334, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Interception", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.877226322889328}, "startOffset": 301, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T23", "text": "Stuart Kettell", "endOffset": 203, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 189, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T24", "text": "owner", "endOffset": 211, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 206, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "Kettell Video Productions", "endOffset": 264, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 239, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "tech scammers", "endOffset": 296, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 283, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T25", "text": "malware", "endOffset": 347, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 340, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T26", "text": "infected its network of files", "endOffset": 382, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Interception", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8658236563205719}, "startOffset": 353, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 490, "index": "T19", "endOffset": 493, "text": "pay"}, "index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Other"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2636, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 2644, "text": "updating"}, "argument": [{"index": "T13", "text": "software patches", "endOffset": 2661, "role": {"type": "Patch"}, "startOffset": 2645, "type": "Patch"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "updates", "endOffset": 2673, "role": {"type": "Patch"}, "startOffset": 2666, "type": "Patch"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2601, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 2605, "text": "plug"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "holes", "endOffset": 2615, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 2610, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1097, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1119, "text": "the demand for payment"}, "index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2869, "index": "T15", "endOffset": 2877, "text": "a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T16", "text": "crime gangs", "endOffset": 2902, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2891, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Boss of hacked company warns of cybercrime threat", "date": "2017_04_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.wmrocu.org.uk/33/section.aspx/32/boss_of_hacked_company_warns_of_cybercrime_threat_"}}
