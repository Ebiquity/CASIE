{"content": "Valentine\u2019s Day is fast-approaching and the story goes that if Cupid hits you with his golden arrow you\u2019ll fall madly in love. But there are other actors taking aim at you on Valentine\u2019s Day whose arrows you need to avoid as the outcomes aren\u2019t nearly as desirable. Think back to early February 2016, when many online florists experienced a surge in traffic that wasn\u2019t due simply to a rush to buy flowers. Dozens of florists were hit by targeted DDoS attacks during their busiest time of the year, causing problems for some and knocking others offline who were asked to pay a ransom before they could resume operations. It\u2019s fairly typical for bad actors to escalate extortion-based campaigns during seasonal events when the stakes for targets are high. Looking to profit with minimal investment, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities as they attempt to breach systems. For example, the 2016 Valentine\u2019s Day DDoS attacks used Shellshock, a critical vulnerability that\u2019s present in Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X that had been discovered more than a year earlier. Of course, online florists are not alone when it comes to being targeted by cyber criminals. Different times of the year and major news events can trigger a surge in attacks aimed at particular industries and geographies. Organisations need to understand their threat model and apply security processes as appropriate. Threat actors will continue to take advantage of events to launch attacks, but you can avoid their arrows this Valentine\u2019s Day.", "sourcefile": "619.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 973, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 983, "text": "present in"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "a critical vulnerability", "endOffset": 965, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 941, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T8", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linux"}, "endOffset": 989, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "Linux", "startOffset": 984, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unix"}, "endOffset": 995, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "UNIX", "startOffset": 991, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T10", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q14116"}, "endOffset": 1008, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "Mac OS X", "startOffset": 1000, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "Shellshock", "endOffset": 939, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 929, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "DDoS attacks", "endOffset": 923, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.8889928460121155}, "startOffset": 911, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1014, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1033, "text": "had been discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "a year earlier", "endOffset": 1058, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1044, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 426, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 434, "text": "were hit"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "DDoS attacks", "endOffset": 459, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9061815142631531}, "startOffset": 447, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "florists", "endOffset": 425, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 417, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 557, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 583, "text": "were asked to pay a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "DDoS attacks", "endOffset": 459, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9061815142631531}, "startOffset": 447, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "florists", "endOffset": 425, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 417, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 668, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 693, "text": "extortion-based campaigns"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "bad actors", "endOffset": 655, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 645, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "SecurityBrief Asia - Digital Shadows on why it's sometimes best to avoid \"Cupid's\" arrow", "date": "2017_02_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://securitybrief.asia/story/digital-shadows-why-its-sometimes-best-avoid-cupids-arrow/"}}
