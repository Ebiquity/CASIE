{"content": "A researcher discovered, that WhatsApp (or Facebook) could force the WhatsApp mobile client to generate new encryption keys. Due to this, WhatsApp would be able to intercept the key exchange and - of course - would be able to intercept the messages. This is how a man-in-the-middle attack works and it only works when both parties - which are communicating with each other - do not verify the fingerprints of the exchanged keys. Signal and WhatsApp are using a concept called \u201cTOFU\u201d or \u201cTrust on first use\u201d. This means, that when a key is exchanged, this key is trusted as long as the key does not change. Signal and WhatsApp have different default settings what happens, when the key-material of a contact changes: WhatsApp just notifies the user when key material changes. Signal blocks outgoing messages and does not send new messages to a user where the key material has changed. A Signal user has to manually verify the new key by default (in this case, a user should verify the key material in person by scanning the QR code of the fingerprint).", "sourcefile": "194.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 13, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 23, "text": "discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q52410688"}, "endOffset": 38, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "text": "WhatsApp", "startOffset": 30, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Facebook", "wikidataid": "Q355"}, "endOffset": 51, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "text": "Facebook", "startOffset": 43, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "A researcher", "endOffset": 12, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "generate new encryption keys", "endOffset": 123, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9036356806755066}, "startOffset": 95, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "intercept the key exchange", "endOffset": 190, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.8941537737846375}, "startOffset": 164, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "intercept the messages", "endOffset": 248, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Interception", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.911756843328476}, "startOffset": 226, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Why the \"WhatsApp-backdoor\" is not a WhatsApp-backdoor - slashcrypto's page", "date": "2017_01_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://slashcrypto.org/2017/01/13/WhatsApp_backdoor/"}}
