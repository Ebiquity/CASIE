BBC News notes that security researcher Chris Vickery uncovered vulnerabilities in Topps databases back in December of 2015 and June of 2016, but he wasn't able to get a response from the company by email. It's not clear whether the credit card breach was related to the flaws Vickery found. A recent Thales e-Security survey of 1,016 U.S. adults found that fully 88 percent of respondents said they would stop using digital payments if they fell victim to cybercrime as a result of a data breach. Seventy percent said they would stop using digital payments if money was stolen from a linked bank account, 68 percent said they would do so if unauthorized charges appeared on a linked credit card account, and 59 percent said they would do so if their user name and password were stolen. \"The mobile payments industry needs to take note that their future success is based on trust,\" Thales e-Security director of payment strategy Jose Diaz said in a statement. \"And that trust can easily fail if they do not provide the strong protection of their infrastructure, transactions and data that customers expect.\" A separate Thales survey of 1,000 adults in the U.S. and the U.K. recently found that 55 percent of respondents would switch to only using cash at a retailer if they learned that credit card data had been stolen from its systems -- and 20 percent would stop shopping at that retailer altogether", "sourcefile": "48.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 164, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 173, "text": "uncovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "in December of 2015 and June of 2016", "endOffset": 250, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 214, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "vulnerabilities", "endOffset": 189, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 174, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "Topps databases", "endOffset": 208, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 193, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T12", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Vickery", "wikidataid": "Q6212806"}, "endOffset": 163, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "security researcher Chris Vickery", "startOffset": 130, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 395, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 400, "text": "found"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Vickery", "wikidataid": "Q6212806"}, "endOffset": 394, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Vickery", "startOffset": 387, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "flaws", "endOffset": 386, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 381, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1418, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 1429, "text": "been stolen"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "its systems", "endOffset": 1446, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1435, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q161380"}, "endOffset": 1413, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "text": "credit card data", "startOffset": 1397, "type": "PII"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 339, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 361, "text": "the credit card breach"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Databreach", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 884, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 895, "text": "were stolen"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "password", "endOffset": 883, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 875, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "user name", "endOffset": 870, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 861, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "they", "endOffset": 839, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 835, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Topps Data Breach Exposes Months of Credit Card Data", "date": "2017_01_04", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.esecurityplanet.com/network-security/topps-data-breach-exposes-months-of-credit-card-data.html"}}
