{"content": "There are so many data breaches these days that it\u2019s almost impossible to keep a track of them. From billions of Yahoo accounts to millions of\u00a0LinkedIn and MySpace accounts the whole thing is out of control. But then there are people dedicating time to track large-scale breaches. One of them is Troy Hunt from Australia whose running Have I been pwned (HIBP) platform and has recently discovered two different \u201ccombo lists\u201d containing 593,427,119 and 457,962,538 = 1,051,389,657\u00a0user login credentials. According to Hunt blog post, While discussing the second list Hunt said that:\u00a0 For now, Hunt has uploaded over\u00a01 billion breached accounts on\u00a0HIBP containing collections of\u00a0email addresses and passwords from around the world, the authentication of which has been confirmed by Hunt himself. Although unconfirmed yet, it seems like the hackers, scammers, and cybercriminals developed these lists from various systems and previous large-scale data breaches including VerticalScope, MySpace, LinkedIn, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo,\u00a0Tumblr and Adobe Systems etc. Hunt has also revealed, \u201c75.78% of the leaked addresses were already in HIBP database.\u201d This means the lists were defiantly\u00a0developed with the help of previous data breaches.\u00a0As a security journalist, I can confirm my personal email account is also on the list. 1 billion new records in @haveibeenpwned from different unknown sources.Lot of people will be notified they're pwned https://t.co/qDkz7t3IbR \u2014 John Opdenakker (@j_opdenakker) May 5, 2017 Meanwhile, we highly recommend visiting Hunt\u2019s post here and his\u00a0Have I been pwned (HIBP) platform to check whether your email is on the list. If it is, change its password right now and also use a password manager to get hold of a strong password. Furthermore, make sure you are not using the same password on other sites but if you are; make sure to change all passwords before it\u2019s too late.\u00a0 Remember, hackers, scammers, and cyber criminals can conduct identity theft scams, social engineering\u00a0attacks and even steal your banking details using your personal data.\u00a0 DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "sourcefile": "2147.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 944, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 957, "text": "data breaches"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "cybercriminals", "endOffset": 875, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 861, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "scammers", "endOffset": 855, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 847, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 845, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 838, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "Adobe Systems", "endOffset": 1051, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1038, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T14", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q384060"}, "endOffset": 1033, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Tumblr", "startOffset": 1027, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T13", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q37093"}, "endOffset": 1025, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Yahoo", "startOffset": 1020, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "Dropbox", "endOffset": 1018, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1011, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T11", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q918"}, "endOffset": 1009, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Twitter", "startOffset": 1002, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T10", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q213660"}, "endOffset": 1000, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "LinkedIn", "startOffset": 992, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q40629"}, "endOffset": 990, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "MySpace", "startOffset": 983, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "VerticalScope", "endOffset": 981, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 968, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "systems", "endOffset": 918, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 911, "type": "System"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 18, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 31, "text": "data breaches"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "these days", "endOffset": 42, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 32, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2021, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 2026, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "cyber criminals", "endOffset": 1950, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1935, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "scammers", "endOffset": 1929, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1921, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 1919, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1912, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "banking details", "endOffset": 2047, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 2032, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "personal data", "endOffset": 2072, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 2059, "type": "PII"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1217, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 1230, "text": "data breaches"}, "index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Databreach", "realis": "Generic"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Anti Public Combo List with Billions of Accounts Leaked", "date": "2017_05_08", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.hackread.com/anti-public-combo-list-with-billions-of-accounts-leaked/"}}
