{"content": "Skirt Club is a place for lesbian and bisexual women to play out their fantasies, and it\u2019s known for being discreet. But that doesn\u2019t seem to apply when it comes to the online privacy component, according to Vice Germany. All the data collected by us is stored on a secure server. Not enough, according to Vice, which reported that Skirt Club kept members\u2019 photos easily accessible online. With\u00a0more than 5,000 members worldwide\u00a0\u2013 many of whom are not open about this part of their lives \u2013 the potential privacy violations are significant. Vice included an example of those compromised: a 39-year-old woman who had been married for 15 years and said in her profile that \u201cNo one knows that I am bi in my environment. Vice Germany investigated\u00a0after anonymous sources contacted the publication to voice concerns\u00a0with the site, which went dark\u00a0around 1 pm. Vice published a feature on Skirt Club in October 2016, which is probably why it was contacted about this. After they looked into those claims, the editors found that at that time,\u00a0thousands\u00a0of personal images that members had uploaded\u00a0in order to\u00a0join Skirt Club\u00a0were accessible to non-members \u2013 photos of users\u00a0partially\u00a0or fully naked, often recognizable, sometimes even with their names mentioned in the image. You didn\u2019t need to hack the site to see\u00a0\u2013\u00a0they weren\u2019t password protected and\u00a0anyone curious enough to make a bit of an effort\u00a0could\u00a0view and download the photos. Vice was particularly critical of how\u00a0Skirt Club dealt\u00a0with the issue: After\u00a0VICE Germany reported the security issues to Skirt Club in mid-December 2016, it took Skirt Club\u00a0more than three weeks to patch\u00a0the issue. The users\u2019 pictures and data\u00a0aren\u2019t accessible any more, but the security issue isn\u2019t resolved completely \u2013\u00a0and\u00a0at the\u00a0time of publication, Skirt Club hasn\u2019t informed users\u00a0of the former problem. Naked Security reached out to Skirt Club, which directed press inquiries toward its attorney: Skirt Club is directing all media enquiries to its lawyer,\u00a0Dr Sebastian Gorski at Schertz Bergmann Rechtsanw\u00e4lte in Berlin.", "sourcefile": "439.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1522, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 1530, "text": "reported"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vice_Media", "wikidataid": "Q18395343"}, "endOffset": 1521, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "VICE Germany", "startOffset": 1509, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "the security issues", "endOffset": 1550, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1531, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "Skirt Club", "endOffset": 1564, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "startOffset": 1554, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "mid-December 2016", "endOffset": 1585, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1568, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1628, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 1636, "text": "to patch"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "Skirt Club", "endOffset": 1605, "role": {"type": "Releaser"}, "startOffset": 1595, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "the issue", "endOffset": 1646, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1637, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "more than three weeks", "endOffset": 1627, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1606, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Sex club for women exposes members\u2019 private photographs \u2013 Naked Security", "date": "2017_01_31", "type": "text", "link": "https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/01/30/sex-club-for-women-exposes-members-private-photographs/?utm_source=Naked+Security+-+Sophos+List&utm_campaign=49ed7c6d3e-naked%252Bsecurity&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_31623bb782-49ed7c6d3e-455160889"}}
