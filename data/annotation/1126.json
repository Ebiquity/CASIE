{"content": "Small and medium businesses across Europe are being actively targeted by ransomware attacks, new research has shown. According to data protection firm Datto, 87% of European IT service providers it surveyed said their SMB customers had been hit by a ransomware attack at some point during the previous 12 months. Additionally, 40% of respondents reported multiple attacks during that time. Just over a quarter of respondents (27%) reported experiencing multiple attacks in a single day. In terms of the impact these attacks are having, the survey revealed the average ransom demanded was between \u00a3500 and \u00a32000. In 15% of reported cases the demand was in excess of \u00a32000. Nearly half (47%) said paying the ransom was ineffective, as they still lost some of the data that had been encrypted by the attackers. As well as financial penalties, ransomware attacks can also impact the business in other ways. A majority of respondents (62%) said they\u2019d experienced downtime during the attack. For smaller organizations, the combination of financial loss and downtime can threaten the continued operation of the business, Datto said. Frustratingly, just 40% of ransomware victims end up reporting the crime to the authorities. The FBI has previously said that reporting ransomware attacks will help it get a better understanding of exactly how many attacks are occurring as well as help the industry develop its defenses; traditional antivirus has so far proved to be ineffectual against most ransomware. \u201cRansomware is more than just a nuisance; it\u2019s a major money-making operation backed by professional and well-funded organizations,\u201d said Andrew Stuart, managing director, EMEA at Datto.", "sourcefile": "1126.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 250, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 267, "text": "ransomware attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "the previous 12 months", "endOffset": 311, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 289, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 232, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 244, "text": "had been hit"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "their SMB customers", "endOffset": 231, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 212, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 73, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 91, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1263, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 1281, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 695, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 712, "text": "paying the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "lost some of the data that had been encrypted", "endOffset": 789, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Shared Data Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8988211452960968}, "startOffset": 744, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "the attackers", "endOffset": 806, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 793, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 4, "events": [{"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 840, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 858, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q4830453"}, "endOffset": 887, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "business", "startOffset": 879, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 5, "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 568, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 583, "text": "ransom demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "\u00a3500", "endOffset": 600, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 596, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "\u00a32000", "endOffset": 610, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 605, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "SMBs Increasingly Targeted in Ransomware Attacks", "date": "2018_03_16", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/smbs-targeted-ransomware/"}}
