{"content": "Morphisec researchers have spotted another attack campaign using fileless malware that is believed to be mounted by the infamous FIN7 hacking group. The goal of the campaign is to gain control of the target businesses\u2019 systems, install a backdoor, and through it perform continual exfiltration of financial information. \u201cLike past attacks, the initial infection vector is a malicious Word document attached to a phishing email that is well-tailored to the targeted business and its day-to-day operations,\u201d the researchers noted.  \u201cThe Word document executes a fileless attack that uses DNS queries to deliver the next shellcode stage (Meterpreter). However, in this new variant, all the DNS activity is initiated and executed solely from memory \u2013 unlike previous attacks which used PowerShell commands.\u201d The researchers attribute this one important change to the group\u2019s efforts to stay one step ahead of the defenders, and they are succeeding:  \u201cAfter decryption of the second stage shellcode, the shellcode deletes the \u2018MZ\u2019 prefix from within a very important part of the shellcode. This prefix indicates it may be a DLL, and its deletion helps the attack to evade memory scanning solutions,\u201d the researchers found. \u201cIf this DLL was saved on disk, many security solutions would immediately identify it as a CobaltStrike Meterpreter, which is used by many attackers and pen testers.\u201d But it\u2019s not, and it passes undetected. In-memory resident attacks and the use of fileless malware are on the rise, and FIN7 is one group that has been employing this approach regularly.  There can be no doubt other attackers will try to implement the same tactic. FIN7 has previously been tied to a sophisticated spear-phishing campaign hitting US-based businesses with emails purportedly coming from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Morphisec researchers believe that the series of attacks leveraged against 140+ banks and other businesses earlier this year is also their work. FIN7 is also associated with the infamous Carbanak gang, but whether they are one and the same it\u2019s still impossible to say for sure.", "sourcefile": "2901.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1763, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 1786, "text": "purportedly coming from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "emails", "endOffset": 1762, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1756, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)", "endOffset": 1834, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 1791, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1699, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1730, "text": "spear-phishing campaign hitting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "FIN7", "endOffset": 1654, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1650, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "US-based businesses", "endOffset": 1750, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1731, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 432, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 448, "text": "is well-tailored"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "malicious Word document attached", "endOffset": 406, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.889190673828125}, "startOffset": 374, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "phishing email", "endOffset": 426, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 412, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q4830453"}, "endOffset": 473, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "business", "startOffset": 465, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 281, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 293, "text": "exfiltration"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "financial information", "endOffset": 318, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 297, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "install a backdoor", "endOffset": 246, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Privilege Abuse", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9160797894001007}, "startOffset": 228, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "gain control of the target businesses\u2019 systems", "endOffset": 226, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Excavation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9392057061195374}, "startOffset": 180, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "US restaurants targeted with fileless malware - Help Net Security", "date": "2017_06_16", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/06/15/us-restaurants-targeted-fileless-malware/"}}
