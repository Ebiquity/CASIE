{"content": "Millions of student, staff\u00a0and faculty email addresses\u00a0and passwords from 300 of the largest universities in the United States have been stolen and are being circulated\u00a0by cyber criminals on the dark web, according to a recent report.\u00a0 Hacktivists, scam artists and even terrorists intend to sell, trade or just give\u00a0away the addresses and passwords, said the Digital Citizens Alliance\u00a0report.\u00a0 During eight years of scanning the dark web\u2014the\u00a0portion of the Internet\u00a0not indexed for open searches,\u00a0where criminals covertly operate\u2014researchers from the security firm ID Agent discovered nearly 14 million addresses and passwords belonging to faculty, staff, students and alumni\u00a0available to cyber criminals. Of those, 79 percent of the credentials were placed there within the last year.\u00a0 The nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance, based in Washington, D.C., wanted to demonstrate in its recent report\u00a0the scale and complexity of the problem\u00a0facing large organizations that try\u00a0to protect email users. \"Higher education institutions have deployed resources and talent to make university communities safer, but highly\u00a0skilled and opportunistic\u00a0cyber criminals make it a challenge to protect large groups of highly\u00a0desirable digital targets,\"\u00a0the group's Deputy Executive Director, Adam Benson, says in a statement. \"We shared this information from cybersecurity researchers to create more awareness of just what kinds of things threat actors are capable of doing with a .edu account.\" ID Agent noted that large Midwestern\u00a0institutions appear to be the most vulnerable, although it is\u00a0not clear why they are\u00a0targets. Topping the list is the University of Michigan, with 122,556 email addresses found on the dark web,\u00a0followed by Penn State University, the University of Minnesota, Michigan State University, Ohio State University and\u00a0the University of Illinois. \"Cyber criminals are motivated to be successful, so it's not surprising to see a significant number of stolen .edu accounts attributed to large and prestigious technical schools,\" Brian Dunn, ID Agent's managing partner, says in a statement. Criminals and hacktivists can use the fake emails to scam others or take advantage of discounts offered to students and faculty on products such as software. Higher education institutions have taken steps to beef up their cybersecurity postures, especially after the Research and Education Networking Information Sharing and Analysis Center last year alerted officials to compromised credentials. \"Universities are aware of the reuse problem and have worked hard to educate members of the university community how to protect themselves,\" according to the Digital Citizens Alliance. \"We\u00a0saw examples of pages on [university-operated] websites explaining how to create effective passphrases and use two-factor authentication.\"", "sourcefile": "1602.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2152, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 2156, "text": "scam"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q7821851"}, "endOffset": 2163, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "others", "startOffset": 2157, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "use the fake emails", "endOffset": 2148, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8914618194103241}, "startOffset": 2129, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "hacktivists", "endOffset": 2124, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2113, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "Criminals", "endOffset": 2108, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2099, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "take advantage of discounts offered", "endOffset": 2202, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8680465817451477}, "startOffset": 2167, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "students", "endOffset": 2214, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2206, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "faculty", "endOffset": 2226, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2219, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 127, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 143, "text": "have been stolen"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States", "wikidataid": "Q30"}, "endOffset": 126, "role": {"type": "Place"}, "text": "the United States", "startOffset": 109, "type": "GPE"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "the largest universities", "endOffset": 105, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 81, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "300", "endOffset": 77, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 74, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "passwords", "endOffset": 68, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 59, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "faculty email addresses", "endOffset": 54, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 31, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "staff", "endOffset": 26, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 21, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q334375"}, "endOffset": 19, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "student", "startOffset": 12, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "Millions", "endOffset": 8, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "cyber criminals", "endOffset": 187, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 172, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Cyber Attack 101: Criminals Go After U.S. Universities | SIGNAL Magazine", "date": "2017_04_11", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.afcea.org/content/?q=cyber-attack-101-criminals-go-after-us-universities"}}
