{"content": "Chrome users have lately been targeted with a few unusual malware delivery and scam attempts. The first one comes from compromised WordPress sites that have been modified to include JavaScript that changes the text rendering. A visitor sees the page as an unreadable mish-mash of symbols, and is prompted to update \u201cChrome\u2019s language pack\u201d so that the text is rendered correctly and he or she is able to read it: \u201cThe usage of a a clean, well-formatted dialog to present the message with the correct Chrome logo \u2013 and, more importantly, \u2013 the correct shade of blue for the update button. The shape of the update button seems correct, and the spelling and grammar are definitely good enough to get a pass,\u201d NeoSmart Technologies\u2019 Mahmoud Al-Qudsi noted. wrong version numbers) during the download and installation process, but not all will. The bad news is that Windows Defender or Chrome don\u2019t flag the file as malware and, at the time of the initial discovery, very few AV engines detected it as malicious (the situation is much better now). Chrome will tell users that \u201cthis file isn\u2019t downloaded very often\u201d as a warning of its potential malicious nature, but that\u2019s unlikely to stop users who are accustomed to click through security warnings. The second threat comes in the form of a malicious Chrome extension that is pushed onto visitors of compromised sites. The potential victims are redirected to such sites mostly through malvertising schemes, and they are faced with the request to install the extension in order to be able to leave the site \u2013 no other option is given, and the browser is stuck in a never ending loop of fullscreen modes. The extension aims to redirect victims to unwanted software, get-rich-quick schemes, and various scams. \u201cThis extension ensures it stays in hiding by using a 1\u00d71 pixel image as its logo and by hooking chrome://extensions and chrome://settings such that any attempt to access those is automatically redirected to chrome://apps. That makes it much more difficult for the average user to see what extensions they have, let alone uninstalling one of them,\u201d Malwarebytes\u2019 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura explains. Victims will have to use a security solution to do it, and likely another browser to search for it and install it.
