{"content": "CHESAPEAKE, Va. - An attack on computers at Grassfield High School has students and parents concerned. Chesapeake Public Schools says a malware attack is responsible for taking the school off the grid. The school district said a virus entered their network through phishing emails sent to employees. Only a couple of divisions have been affected and it's not a system-wide outage. However, it impacted Grassfield High School in a big way. Classes heavily relying on technology were affected, but the others carried on as usual.", "sourcefile": "10022.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 281, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 288, "text": "sent to"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "employees", "endOffset": 298, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 289, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "a virus entered their network", "endOffset": 256, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Malware spreading", "confidence": 0.8091520071029663}, "startOffset": 227, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q7432244"}, "endOffset": 221, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "The school district", "startOffset": 202, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "phishing emails", "endOffset": 280, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 265, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Chesapeake Public Schools\u2019 computer network affected by malware from phishing emails", "date": "2018_11_08", "type": "text", "link": "https://wtkr.com/2018/11/08/chesapeake-public-schools-computer-network-affected-by-malware-from-phishing-emails/"}}
