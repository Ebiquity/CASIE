{"content": "The average company had four ransomware attacks last year, paid an average ransom of $2,500 per incident, and spent 42 hours dealing with the attack. \"We're nowhere near the end of the ransomware threat,\" said Norman Guadagno, chief evangelist at Carbonite, which provides continuous automated cloud backup services. Of those who did not pay up, 42 percent said that having a full and accurate backup was the reason. And only 13 percent said their preparedness to prevent ransomware was \"high.\" \"People say, 'I know I should back up, have anti-virus, use strong passwords' -- but they don't do it,\" said Guadagno. Only 46 percent of respondents said that prevention of ransomware attacks was a high priority for their company. One reason could be that they don't think the hackers will bother with them. According to the survey, 55 percent of companies said they thought it was either likely or certain that the ransomware also exfiltrated data from the infected device. Businesses should not only have anti-virus in place to keep ransomware from getting in, but also train their employees to spot potential attacks. According to the survey, only 29 percent of respondents said they were confident that their employees could detect risky links or sites. It just goes to show that you can't even trust cybercriminals these days.", "sourcefile": "332.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 29, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 47, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "last year", "endOffset": 57, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 48, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "The average company", "endOffset": 19, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 59, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 63, "text": "paid"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "$2,500", "endOffset": 91, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 85, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 75, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 81, "text": "ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "$2,500", "endOffset": 91, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 85, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 928, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 939, "text": "exfiltrated"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "data", "endOffset": 944, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 940, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q926331"}, "endOffset": 922, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "the ransomware", "startOffset": 908, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "the infected device", "endOffset": 969, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 950, "type": "Device"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 138, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 148, "text": "the attack"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Report: Half of ransomware's SMB victims pay up | CSO Online", "date": "2017_01_24", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.csoonline.com/article/3160905/backup-recovery/report-half-of-ransomwares-smb-victims-pay-up.html"}}
