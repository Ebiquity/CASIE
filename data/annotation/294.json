{"content": "Hawksmoor Investment Management has sought to reassure clients after it was the victim of a cyber attack earlier this week. The discretionary investment manager, which runs \u00a3711m on behalf of clients, has emailed investors to let them know it was the target of an attack on its IT systems. Phishing emails were sent out to clients on Tuesday (17 January) purporting to be from the company\u2019s business development manager, Jill Gill. In an email sent out today (19 January), Hawksmoor chief executive John Crowley apologised to clients, but said the IT team had quickly identified and resolved the issue. He also said the team had taken \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to prevent this kind of incident from happening again. \u201cHawksmoor treats confidentiality and data protection extremely seriously, and I can assure you that no client data was compromised at any stage,\u201d he said. Mr Crowley advised clients to delete any emails they received from Ms Gill between 3pm and 4pm on the 17 January. He also recommended that customers change their password if they opened any link on the emails. Last year, the head of cyber technology firm ZoneFox said companies should implement a framework to guard against breaches to their data security", "sourcefile": "294.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 355, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 371, "text": "purporting to be"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "the company", "endOffset": 388, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 377, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "business development manager", "endOffset": 419, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 391, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jill_Roberts", "wikidataid": "Q55094695"}, "endOffset": 430, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "Jill Gill", "startOffset": 421, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 306, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 315, "text": "were sent"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "clients", "endOffset": 330, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 323, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "Tuesday (17 January)", "endOffset": 354, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 334, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Phishing emails", "endOffset": 305, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 290, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "DFM hit by cyber attack - FTAdviser.com", "date": "2017_01_20", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2017/01/19/dfm-hit-by-cyber-attack/"}}
