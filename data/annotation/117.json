{"content": "Ransomware will continue to dominate the cyber security landscape, with a new report from security specialists ESET forecasting the \u2018year of ransomware\u2019 will continue into 2017. ESET\u2019s Trends 2017: Security held ransom presents key cyber security topics of relevance for both businesses and consumers about the latest threats taking shape in the new year and identifies ransomware as a key threat to protect against. The report suggests ransomware will continue en masse. \u201cWe anticipate a new trend on the horizon: The Ransomware of Things or RoT, i.e. the possibility of cybercriminals \u201chijacking\u201d devices such as home security cameras and then demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring control to the user,\u201d ESET says in the report. Nick FitzGerald, senior research fellow at ESET agrees that ransomware attacks will continue to increase in ANZ throughout 2017. \u201cRansomware was a serious security problem throughout 2016. ESET takes no joy from having been on the right side of that prediction, nor in predicting that ongoing ransomware developments and ensuing success for the cybercriminals behind it seems likely to continue apace into 2017,\u201d FitzGerald says. \u201cAs wealthy markets, Australia and New Zealand are often targeted in ransomware campaigns, and online users should continue to be especially wary of unsolicited email with attachments or URLs, and \u2018too good to be true\u2019 offers,\u201d he says. According to FitzGerald, with the cost of\u00a0cybercrime rising more than 200%\u00a0over the past five years alone, ESET assembled the report to not only help businesses and individuals understand the advanced tactics and techniques employed by criminal hackers, but to safeguard against threats in the coming year. \u201cConsidering the adverse reputational as well as financial impacts which result from cybercrime, it is critical that all users are aware of the types of attacks that can affect them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe report also highlights the importance of continual education as one of the essential components for staying safe online and offers its readers simple steps for raising one\u2019s level of awareness\u201d.", "sourcefile": "117.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1245, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 1265, "text": "ransomware campaigns"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Zealand", "wikidataid": "Q664"}, "endOffset": 1222, "role": {"type": "Place"}, "text": "New Zealand", "startOffset": 1211, "type": "GPE"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australia", "wikidataid": "Q408"}, "endOffset": 1206, "role": {"type": "Place"}, "text": "Australia", "startOffset": 1197, "type": "GPE"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 806, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 824, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "2017", "endOffset": 873, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 869, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 646, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 672, "text": "demanding a ransom payment"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "home security cameras", "endOffset": 636, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 615, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "\u201chijacking\u201d devices", "endOffset": 606, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9078046083450317}, "startOffset": 587, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "cybercriminals", "endOffset": 586, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 572, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "the user", "endOffset": 718, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 710, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "SecurityBrief NZ - Ransomware to dominate cyber security landscape", "date": "2017_01_09", "type": "text", "link": "https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/ransomware-dominate-cyber-security-landscape/"}}
