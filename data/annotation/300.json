{"content": "Over 700 computers at all of SLPL's 16 branches have been hit. According to library spokesperson Jen Hatton, SLPL doesn't intend to pay the ransom, which is around $35,000, about $50 per infected PC. Instead, library technicians plan to wipe and reinstall all computers from the ground up, an operation that might take a while, several local news outlets have reported [1, 2, 3, 4]. Hatton said the infection took root on the night between Wednesday and Thursday. By the next day, the library had to shut down all book returns and checkout operations. SLPL libraries also served as public WiFi access points, allowing people to come in and use its Internet connection or computers to surf the web. Internet access is also down, as the ransomware hit those servers as well, along with the staff's email system. It is unknown if the ransomware infection took place because of the library's staff or because of a user that used its public computers. A request for comment sent by Bleeping Computer wasn't answered at the time of publishing. UPDATE [January 23]: SLPL announced today they started recovering some of the locked computers and are slowly resuming service. I've been trying since this morning to get in contact with them.", "sourcefile": "300.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 132, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 146, "text": "pay the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "$35,000", "endOffset": 171, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 164, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "$50", "endOffset": 182, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 179, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q16338"}, "endOffset": 198, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "PC", "startOffset": 196, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka_Premier_League"}, "endOffset": 113, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "SLPL", "startOffset": 109, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Ransomware Locks Down Public Libraries at All Locations Across Saint Louis", "date": "2017_01_23", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-locks-down-public-libraries-at-all-locations-across-saint-louis/"}}
