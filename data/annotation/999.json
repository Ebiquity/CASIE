{"content": "By PennLive Editorial Board penned@pennlive.com With news last week that Pennsylvania Senate Democrats\u00a0(along with about 11 other progressive groups) had apparently fallen prey to an attack by Russian hackers, it's tempting to ask if anyone is safe from the waking Great Bear. Democratic leaders have so far refused to meet the hackers' ransom demand or risk having their data destroyed, The Associated Press reported. The bad news is that the attack is a visceral reminder that no computer network is totally immune to a takeover by determined cyber-terorrists. It's also a reminder that the United States disregards this foreign threat at its peril. And it is one that is growing in its size and scope.
