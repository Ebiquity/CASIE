{"content": "This Locky spam dip has been seen by multiple observers, such as security firms Avast and Check Point, and security researchers Kevin Beaumont, MalwareTech, MalwareHunterTeam, and others. According to Check Point, who recently released a report on December's most active malware families, Locky spam numbers have gone down 81%. Previously, in October, Locky had been ranked as the top malware threat in the world, while now, in December, Locky is not even in the top 10 anymore. The same thing can also be seen in a chart released by Avast. Even if the chart doesn't cover the last ten days, Locky spam numbers have remained at the same low levels as during the holidays. The only tiny trail of activity in the chart above is the Locky ransomware delivered as a second-stage download for Kovter campaigns. Kovter is a click-fraud malware that infects computers and clicks on invisible ads on the user's behalf. This malware has been around for years, and recently, it started distributing a wide range of secondary payloads. In January 2016, Kovter downloaded and installed a proxy client on infected PCs, transforming infected hosts into proxy servers for the ProxyGate web proxy service. This allowed the Kovter gang to make a side profit by routing web traffic through infected PCs, while also earning money from its main activity: click-fraud. In the same month, Kovter also started distributing a version of the Nemucod ransomware, for which Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft had successfully created a decrypter. Disheartened by Wosar's success, the group behind Kovter switched to several ransomware variants in the following months, and eventually settled on renting and distributing Locky starting with October, as part of an affiliate scheme, splitting the ransom payments with the Locky crew. Researchers looking at Locky infections can easily track Locky infections distributed by the Kovter group by the affiliate IDs 23 and 24, found in Locky's configuration file, present on every infected system. PhishMe researchers have recently published a blog post detailing the Kovter spam emails that has been distributing Locky ransomware in the past weeks. At the moment, these spam emails are the only source of Locky infections. Previously, most of the spam emails distributing Locky came from the spam sent out via Necurs, a botnet of PCs infected with the Necurs bootkit. The Necurs botnet is the same botnet responsible for the distribution of the Dridex banking trojan, one of the most advanced banking trojans known today.", "sourcefile": "248.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1754, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 1773, "text": "the ransom payments"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "the Locky crew", "endOffset": 1793, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1779, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "October", "endOffset": 1710, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1703, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q22920668"}, "endOffset": 1688, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "Locky", "startOffset": 1683, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2285, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 2289, "text": "came"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "the spam emails", "endOffset": 2265, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 2250, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "distributing Locky", "endOffset": 2284, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Malware spreading", "confidence": 0.8568408489227295}, "startOffset": 2266, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "the spam sent out", "endOffset": 2312, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8412622213363647}, "startOffset": 2295, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q24897019"}, "endOffset": 2323, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "Necurs", "startOffset": 2317, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Locky Ransomware Activity Goes Down by 81%", "date": "2017_01_18", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/locky-ransomware-activity-goes-down-by-81-percent/"}}
