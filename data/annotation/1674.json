{"content": "A Warwick company\u2019s managing director is warning other businesses to protect themselves from cyber criminals after being held to ransom. Kettell Video Productions was targeted by tech scammers who infected its IT systems with viruses before demanding \u00a31,000 in online currency Bitcoins or the files would be permanently deleted. Luckily, owner Stuart Kettell routinely backs up all his company\u2019s systems so nothing was lost but he warned others to do the same to avoid disaster. \u201cIt was scary: I had no idea about cyber-attacks before and really didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said.  \u201cCritical files, including images and videos for clients, were wiped out along with a lifetime of personal memories. \u201cThe affected files were lost for good \u2013 the only way to recover them was with the key code held by the blackmailer \u2013 but luckily I back-up everything to an external data cartridge.  \u201cIn the end it was more an inconvenience\u2026but it could have threatened the business. \u201cI would strongly urge all business owners to back-up their essential files.\u201d Mr Kettell acted quickly when he realised the audio-visual specialists in Arlescote Close were under attack by the web sharks in December, 2015. \u201cI noticed all my photos, videos and pdf files ghosting to white with a new filename\u2026 it attacked my desktop first then it wormed its way into folders one file at a time every few seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea how the malware was introduced as we use software that\u2019s designed to prevent against such attacks.  \u201cAnd the demand for payment seemed very professional: I was given links where I could buy Bitcoins and even offered the chance to decrypt one file for free. \u201cI unplugged my computer, isolated it from the internet, and ran some anti-malware software to stop the virus spreading further.\u201d Latest figures from the Crime Survey for England & Wales estimated there were 1.3m computer virus offences and 667,000 hacking related offences committed in the year ending September 2016. Sergeant Gary Sirrell from the cybercrime team at West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit said commercial web attacks are increasingly being committed against smaller firms and not big multi-nationals. \u201cSmall and medium sized companies are easier targets: they often don\u2019t have the resources or expertise to protect against cyberattacks,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd if they are targeted, the impact can be devastating.  \u201cBut there are steps business owners can take to mitigate the risk.  \u201cA really effective tactic involves \u2018layering\u2019 defences to include a firewall, anti-malware software, staff training and regular re-training) around phishing email awareness, and finally to plug any holes in your defences by updating software patches and updates in a timely manner. \u201cBy exercising good cyber hygiene, and having a strong backup policy, Stuart avoided the dilemma of whether to see his business significantly damaged, or to have to hand over a ransom to organised crime gangs to get his data unlocked.  \u201cIf more businesses in the West Midlands proactively took such steps there would be significantly fewer crimes victims.\u201d ", "sourcefile": "1674.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2648, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 2652, "text": "plug"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "text": "any holes", "endOffset": 2662, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 2653, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2683, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 2691, "text": "updating"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "software patches", "endOffset": 2708, "role": {"type": "Patch"}, "startOffset": 2692, "type": "Patch"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 2713, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 2720, "text": "updates"}, "index": "E6", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "subtype": "PatchVulnerability", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 241, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 250, "text": "demanding"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "\u00a31,000", "endOffset": 257, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 251, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "in online currency Bitcoins", "endOffset": 285, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 258, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "infected its IT systems with viruses", "endOffset": 233, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8891630470752716}, "startOffset": 197, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Kettell Video Productions", "endOffset": 162, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 137, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "tech scammers", "endOffset": 192, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 179, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 1506, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1528, "text": "the demand for payment"}, "index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}, {"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2916, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 2924, "text": "a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T18", "text": "crime gangs", "endOffset": 2949, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2938, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T20", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q41402"}, "endOffset": 2817, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Stuart", "startOffset": 2811, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 115, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 135, "text": "being held to ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "cyber criminals", "endOffset": 108, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 93, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "other businesses", "endOffset": 65, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 49, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q24088601"}, "endOffset": 37, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "managing director", "startOffset": 20, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "Warwick company", "endOffset": 17, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Warwick business owner\u2019s warning after cyber attack blackmail - Warwick Courier", "date": "2017_04_14", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.warwickcourier.co.uk/news/crime/warwick-business-owner-s-warning-after-cyber-attack-blackmail-1-7914478"}}
