{"content": "A malvertising campaign is targeting iOS devices with a VPN that doesn't hide the fact it collects large quantities of users' information. It also employs the aggressive tactic of playing a high-pitch beeping. To help address the \"issues\" the site provides a link to a program called \"My Mobile Secure.\" \"We have detected that your Mobile Safari is (45.4%) DAMAGED by BROWSER TROJAN VIRUSES picked up while surfing recent corrupted sites. When someone clicks \"Remove Virus,\" their device presents an installation prompt for a VPN called \"My Mobile Secure.\" My Mobile Secure is linked by users' emails to MobileXpression, a market firm which seeks to study web behavior by collecting users' information. If the intent is to use a VPN to anonymize your online activities, this does almost the opposite.\" It's reasonable to expect nothing more from a malvertising campaign. With that said, users should take great care to not click on suspicious ads and should consider installing an ad-blocker in their web browsers. They should also consider downloading a VPN, but they should make sure to research VPN providers and their privacy policies carefully before they choose a solution.", "sourcefile": "1560.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 90, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 98, "text": "collects"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "iOS devices", "endOffset": 48, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 37, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "A malvertising campaign", "endOffset": 23, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Excavation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8500895202159882}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "information", "endOffset": 137, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 126, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "users", "endOffset": 124, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 119, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 218, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 225, "text": "address"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "the \"issues\"", "endOffset": 238, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 226, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 672, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 682, "text": "collecting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "information", "endOffset": 701, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 690, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "users", "endOffset": 688, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 683, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Malvertising campaign pushes data-collecting VPN on iOS users", "date": "2017_04_10", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.grahamcluley.com/malvertising-campaign-pushes-data-collecting-vpn-ios-users/"}}
