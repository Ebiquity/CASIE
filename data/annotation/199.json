{"content": "Amazon buyers are being targeted by clever scammers that either set up independent seller accounts or hijack those of already established, well-reputed sellers, then offer pricy items at unbeatable prices. In an example offered by Comparitech\u2019s Lee Munson, the item in question is a big LCD TV that is usually sold at around \u00a32,300, but the scammer offers it at almost half the price for a \u201cused \u2013 like new\u201d item. But when the potential victim tries to buy it, Amazon throws up an error, saying that there was a problem with the item in the order. A determined buyer will try to contact the seller through Amazon\u2019s in-house messaging system, but the seller will push to move the conversation off it by offering a contact email address. Munson\u2019s email exchange with the scammer shows that the latter insists that by contacting them directly the problem has been solved, and that an order confirmation will be sent to the buyers\u2019 email address. The order confirmation looks like it came from Amazon (it appears to come from the auto-confirm@amazon-payments-support.co.uk email address), but was in fact sent by the scammer. The order instructs the user to pay via direct bank transfer, to a private bank account \u2013 seemingly through Amazon Payments, but actually not. Once the victims make the payment in the way they have been instructed, it\u2019s game over. They have parted with their money, and Amazon won\u2019t refund them as the payment hasn\u2019t been effected through their payment system. \u201cPayment within the Amazon.co.uk site is the only authorised and recognised form of payment for items sold by Sellers on Amazon.co.uk. Every customer who orders on Amazon.co.uk is covered by our A-to-z guarantee; however items paid for outside of the Amazon.co.uk Marketplace aren\u2019t eligible for protection,\u201d the company noted, and advised customers to report this type of sellers to them. But even that is not enough to stop these scammers, and they set up new accounts almost immediately after old ones have been blocked, as evidenced in this post on a Kindle Help Forum. Obviously, Amazon must find a way to spot these schemes and take these accounts down much sooner", "sourcefile": "199.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 966, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 976, "text": "looks like"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "The order confirmation", "endOffset": 965, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 943, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 980, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 989, "text": "came from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazon_Video", "wikidataid": "Q4740856"}, "endOffset": 996, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "Amazon", "startOffset": 990, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "it", "endOffset": 979, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 977, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1001, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 1021, "text": "appears to come from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "it", "endOffset": 1000, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 998, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "email address", "endOffset": 1082, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 1069, "type": "PII"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1101, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 1105, "text": "sent"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "scammer", "endOffset": 1120, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1113, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1132, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 1141, "text": "instructs"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "The order", "endOffset": 1131, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1122, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "pay via direct bank transfer, to a private bank account", "endOffset": 1209, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Exploitation of Trusted Credentials", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8897810578346252}, "startOffset": 1154, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "the user", "endOffset": 1150, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1142, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T13", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q4740864"}, "endOffset": 1236, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "Amazon", "startOffset": 1230, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Amazon scammers hijack seller accounts, lure users with good deals - Help Net Security", "date": "2017_01_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/01/12/amazon-scammers-hijack-seller-accounts/"}}
