{"content": "Anyone who uses the popular\u00a0Cisco WebEx extension for Chrome should update to the latest version pronto. Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy recently discovered a serious vulnerability in the Chrome extension that leaves PCs wide open to attack. The magic string was designed to remotely activate the WebEx browser extension. Once the extension was activated the bad guys could execute malicious code on the target machine. The impact on you at home: It\u2019s a good idea for anyone who uses this extension to make sure it\u2019s updated to the latest version given the severity of the vulnerability. It\u2019s not clear if version 1.0.5 offers any significant protection against the threat Ormandy describes. Apparently, all version 1.0.3 did was offer a pop-up anytime that magic code was used, according to Cloudfare security researcher\u00a0Filippo Valsorda. That puts the onus on the user to make sure they really want to be using WebEx when that pop-up appears. If you\u2019d rather not bother with the extension it\u2019s also possible to use a temporary, downloadable desktop program each time you want to use WebEx. That may not be convenient, but it\u2019s an alternative. Ormandy\u2019s discovery raised enough eyebrows that Mozilla blocked WebEx for Firefox.", "sourcefile": "343.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 155, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 165, "text": "discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy", "endOffset": 145, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 105, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "a serious vulnerability", "endOffset": 189, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 166, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T2", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q5583816"}, "endOffset": 213, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "the Chrome extension", "startOffset": 193, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "leaves PCs wide open to attack", "endOffset": 249, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.8913567960262299}, "startOffset": 219, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Severe vulnerability in Cisco's WebEx extension for Chrome leaves PCs open to easy attack | CSO Online", "date": "2017_01_25", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.csoonline.com/article/3161140/software/severe-vulnerability-in-ciscos-webex-extension-for-chrome-leaves-pcs-open-to-easy-attack.html"}}
