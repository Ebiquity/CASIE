{"content": "Washington University School of Medicine is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our patients\u2019 information. We regret, however, that information about some of our patients may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party due to an email \u201cphishing\u201d incident. On January 24, 2017, the medical school learned that some of its employees responded to a Dec 2, 2016, \u201cphishing\u201d email, believing it to be a legitimate request. A \u201cphishing\u201d email is designed to look like a legitimate email but tricks the recipient into taking some action, such as providing login credentials. Upon learning of the incident, we secured the email accounts and began an investigation. The investigation could not rule out that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to some employees\u2019 email accounts. We conducted a detailed review of the employees\u2019 email accounts and confirmed that some of the emails contained patient information, which may have included names, birth dates, medical record numbers, diagnosis and treatment information, other clinical information, and in some instances Social Security numbers. We reported the phishing incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with the investigation. We have no indication that the information in the emails has been misused. However, as a precaution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on March 24, 2017, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions patients may have. If you believe you may be affected and have not received a letter by April 24, 2017, or if you have any questions regarding this incident, please call 844-641-5630. The call center is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. central time. We regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused our patients. To help prevent such incidents in the future, we are reinforcing education with our staff and faculty of existing protocols and university resources regarding \u201cphishing\u201d emails. We also are reviewing enhancements to strengthen our business practices and user login authentication process.", "sourcefile": "10071.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 470, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 491, "text": "designed to look like"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "A \u201cphishing\u201d email", "endOffset": 466, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 448, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "a legitimate email", "endOffset": 510, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 492, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "January 24, 2017", "endOffset": 305, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 289, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T20", "text": "employees", "endOffset": 360, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 351, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T18", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q494230"}, "endOffset": 325, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "the medical school", "startOffset": 307, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T23", "text": "believing it to be a legitimate request", "endOffset": 446, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.889422208070755}, "startOffset": 407, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "\u201cphishing\u201d email", "endOffset": 405, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 389, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "Dec 2, 2016", "endOffset": 387, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 376, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 515, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 521, "text": "tricks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "the recipient", "endOffset": 535, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 522, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "taking some action", "endOffset": 559, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Unauthorized access", "confidence": 0.8219799399375916}, "startOffset": 541, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "providing login credentials", "endOffset": 596, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Gathering data", "confidence": 0.9036102890968323}, "startOffset": 569, "type": "Purpose"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 199, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 217, "text": "have been accessed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "our patients", "endOffset": 194, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 182, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "information", "endOffset": 167, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 156, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "an unauthorized third party", "endOffset": 248, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 221, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "an email \u201cphishing\u201d incident", "endOffset": 284, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8787986934185028}, "startOffset": 256, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 761, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 779, "text": "have gained access"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "an unauthorized third party", "endOffset": 756, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 729, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "email accounts", "endOffset": 813, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 799, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "employees", "endOffset": 797, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 788, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1140, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 1161, "text": "the phishing incident"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Phishing", "realis": "Actual"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Notice to our Patients of Email Phishing Incident", "date": "2017_03_24", "type": "text", "link": "https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/announcements/notice-patients-email-phishing-incident/"}}
