{"content": "The site was taken offline to patch the security bug, and only publicly accessible information was lifted from the compromised web servers, we're told. The flaw in the Struts 2 framework is trivial to exploit: just upload a file with an invalid Content-Type value. It then throws an exception, and opens the target to remote code execution. Shortly after the Struts 2 vulnerability was discovered and documented last week, researchers at Cisco's Talos said they'd observed it under \u201cactive attack\u201d. The Canada Revenue Agency held a press conference in Ottawa Monday afternoon, and confirmed Struts 2 was the reason it took down its services over the weekend. Shared Service Canada COO John Glowacki said while forensic work is continuing, analysis of system logs so far shows nobody \u201cgot inside\u201d CRA's systems. \u201cWe will not speak for other countries, but we will say we have information that some other countries are having greater problems with this specific vulnerability,\u201d he added. Expect vendors to start issuing their own advisories about Struts 2. Cisco has posted its first product advisory, and so far there's more \"confirmed not vulnerable\" than vulnerable products. So far, only Cisco's Identity Services Engine, Prime Service Catalog Virtual Appliance, and Unified SIP Proxy Software need fixing.
