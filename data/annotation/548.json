{"content": "Polish media reported last week that the IT security teams at many Polish banks have been busy recently searching their systems for a particular strain of malware after several unnamed banks found it on their computers. It's not clear what the malware's end goal is, but in at least one case it was used to exfiltrate data from a bank's computer to an external server. The nature of the stolen information could not be immediately determined because it was encrypted, Polish IT news blog Zaufana Trzecia Strona reported Friday. After the malware program is downloaded and executed on a computer, it connects to remote servers and can be used to perform network reconnaissance, lateral movement and data exfiltration, the BadCyber researchers said in a blog post. The malware is similar to other crimeware tools, but has not been documented before.", "sourcefile": "548.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 307, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 317, "text": "exfiltrate"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "it", "endOffset": 294, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 292, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "data", "endOffset": 322, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 318, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q68"}, "endOffset": 345, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "computer", "startOffset": 337, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q22687"}, "endOffset": 334, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "bank", "startOffset": 330, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "malware", "endOffset": 251, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 244, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 698, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 715, "text": "data exfiltration"}, "index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Databreach", "realis": "Actual"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Polish banks on alert after mystery malware found on computers | CSO Online", "date": "2017_02_08", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.csoonline.com/article/3166555/security/polish-banks-on-alert-after-mystery-malware-found-on-computers.html"}}
