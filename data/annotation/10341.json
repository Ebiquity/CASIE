{"content": "Noticed more emails and texts lately claiming to be from your bank \u2013 and not just yours? You\u2019re not the only one. Action Fraud, the UK police\u2019s dedicated fraud tracking team, has revealed a significant increase in reports about phishing attacks connected to TSB\u2019s massive IT outage have been reported. A total of 176 complaints have been received, or around ten a day since April 30. \u201cThere has been an uptick in phishing attempts across the piece,\u201d says an Action Fraud spokesperson. TSB\u2019s banking meltdown, caused by a botched IT upgrade, still has not been remedied \u2013 nearly four weeks on. And the crisis has become paydirt for scammers and hackers, who have waded into a confusing, chaotic situation and are making out with thousands of pounds worth of savings from people\u2019s accounts. And it\u2019s not just TSB - the number of phishing texts claiming to be from other banks such as Barclays and NatWest also seems to be on the rise. \u201cWhen a \u2018change\u2019 goes wrong and so publicly like TSB\u2019s, it\u2019s like cyber blood in the water,\u201d explains Ian Thornton-Trump, chief technical officer of Octopi Managed Services, an IT company. \u201cCyber criminals pay attention to companies rocked by internal scandals or public \u2018ball drops\u2019 and react accordingly.\u201d With the bank\u2019s staff overloaded trying to fix the problems that caused the outage in the first place, fraudulent transactions aren\u2019t being tracked or checked as quickly as they should be. \u201cIt is a sad fact that fraudsters might try to take advantage of situations like these,\u201d says a TSB spokesperson. The scammers are using one of the most common tools in their arsenal: phishing attacks. They send out mass texts and emails to customers \u2013 many of whom identify themselves as TSB\u2019s customers in increasingly irate social media posts \u2013 with links to legitimate-sounding but fraudulent websites. Customers are encouraged to click a link and input their username and password to process their complaints against the company \u2013 and lose control of their bank account. Lucy Evans, 23, is one customer who has had her cash stolen. Her TSB current account was looted, and she\u2019s received a number of texts purporting to be from TSB. She was defrauded by a combination of phone calls and texts. \u201cI think I was targeted whilst we couldn\u2019t actually view our money,\u201d says Evans. \u201cCriminals are happy to exploit people\u2019s misery, whatever form that might take,\u201d says professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity specialist from the University of Surrey. \u201cCriminals can pretend to be the bank and ask customers to undertake strange actions that under normal operations would seem suspicious. Customers might be so delighted to actually be able to access their web banking that they might just let their guard down that little bit more than usual.\u201d TSB has to act more proactively to shut down fraudulent domains and to make the public more aware of the scams circulating, Woodward argues. \u201cTSB need to up their game in responding to customers \u2013 as that very lack of response can be used to lure customers in.\u201d For those who have fallen victim, the loss of money is adding insult to injury. \u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019ll move banks,\u201d says Evans, who lost the contents of her current account. \u201cMost of the staff have been helpful and apologetic, but this should have been resolved by now. It seems they are not fit for purpose.\u201d", "sourcefile": "10341.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual",
