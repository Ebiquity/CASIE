{"content": "The hacker who wants to remain anonymous is part of an underground hacker platform and maintains that the forum was hacked in January 2017. The data was first discovered by data mining company Hacked-DB who found out that the total number of stolen user accounts is 70,000, but after an in-depth scan\u00a0it turned out that 5,000 accounts were a duplicate and the\u00a0exact number of stolen accounts are\u00a065,215. The data includes personal details of registered\u00a0user such as user id, username, email account, IP address and password\u00a0hashed with bcrypt, Blowfish. Among the data,\u00a0there are\u00a040,521 Gmail accounts,\u00a03,261 Yahoo accounts,\u00a02,760 Outlook and\u00a02,760 Hotmail accounts. The forum SSL certificate is already expired\u00a0and Chrome users can see \u201cNot Secure Connection\u201d warning. Also, the forum which is based on phpBB (Free and Open Source Forum Software) is vulnerable to simple SQL injection attack making it easier for the hackers to steal whatever is stored on the server. Airsoft GI is based in California with offices in Taxes and Virginia but, when it comes to the targeted platform, it shows that the last activity on the forum was on Apr 28, 2015. This means the forum is not only unsecure but inactive.", "sourcefile": "745.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 929, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 934, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "the server", "endOffset": 967, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 957, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "the hackers", "endOffset": 925, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 914, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "SQL injection attack", "endOffset": 892, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Buffer Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8951440155506134}, "startOffset": 872, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "the forum", "endOffset": 785, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 776, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q14270"}, "endOffset": 847, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "phpBB (Free and Open Source Forum Software)", "startOffset": 804, "type": "Software"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Gun Retailer Airsoft GI's Forum Hacked; 65,000 User Accounts Leaked", "date": "2017_02_24", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.hackread.com/gun-retailer-airsoft-gi-forums-hacked/"}}
