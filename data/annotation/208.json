{"content": "The same group of hackers that intelligence officials believe swung the US election in favour of Donald Trump has also attacked Norwegian targets within the military and foreign service. Called \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d\u00a0computer security experts believe Russia is behind the hacking that\u2019s aimed at political manipulation and destablization of western democracies. Norway\u2019s foreign ministry has been among the targets of hackers, also abroad. DN reported that the list of targets is\u00a0long, including embassies and ministries in more than 40 countries, several NATO and EU institutions, political and military leaders, well-known journalists, activists and academics. Most haven\u2019t been aware they were attacked when they clicked on links in email that seemed to come from people they knew. The attacks enabled the hackers to steal confidential information by penetrating email accounts and internal systems. The attacks in Norway only make up 2 percent of attacks on military and political institutions, DN reported, but local authorities are on high alert for more. The US\u2019 FBI, CIA and NSA have all described the attacks as the largest Russian attempt to gain influence in the US ever. Russian authorities from President Vladimir Putin\u2019s office on down have vigorously denied they\u2019re behind the hacking. In addition to the attacks on foreign ministry and military interests, email accounts at Norway\u2019s Greens Party (Milj\u00f8partiet De Gr\u00f8nne, MDG) were hacked last June and the attacker gained access to the party\u2019s membership register. A few weeks later, Norway\u2019s Socialist Left party (SV) was also attacked, with the hackers gaining access to SV\u2019s membership register as well. A false profile was established ono the party\u2019s internal debate forum. Both attacks remain under investigation, according to the Oslo Police District. \u201cIt can seem that security is not good enough,\u201d Grandhagen told DN, but it\u2019s\u00a0demanding and expensive for such organizations to fend off the hackers. Norwegian political parties aren\u2019t required by law to test their data systems for possible penetration. \u201cInformation that should not or must never come out should never be sent via Hotmail or email that\u2019s not classified,\u201d Bernsen said.", "sourcefile": "208.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 683, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 696, "text": "were attacked"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "clicked on links in email", "endOffset": 732, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8511328101158142}, "startOffset": 707, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "they", "endOffset": 682, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 678, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 738, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 757, "text": "seemed to come from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "people they knew", "endOffset": 774, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 758, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 811, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 816, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "the hackers", "endOffset": 807, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 796, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "confidential information", "endOffset": 841, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 817, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "penetrating email accounts and internal systems", "endOffset": 892, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9109853506088257}, "startOffset": 845, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 776, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 787, "text": "The attacks"}, "index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Databreach", "realis": "Generic"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "\u2018Fancy Bear\u2019 also growls at Norway", "date": "2017_01_17", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.newsinenglish.no/2017/01/16/fancy-bear-also-growls-at-norway/"}}
