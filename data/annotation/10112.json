{"content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 The hack that forced Baltimore\u2019s 911 dispatch system to be temporarily shut down over the weekend was a ransomware attack, city officials said Wednesday. Such attacks \u2014 another of which occurred in Atlanta last week \u2014 take over parts of private or municipal computer networks and then demand payment, or ransom, for their release. Frank Johnson, chief information officer in the Mayor\u2019s Office of Information Technology, said he was not aware of any specific ransom request made by the hackers of Baltimore\u2019s network, but federal authorities are investigating. \u201cThe systems and the software and the files are all being investigated by the FBI right now,\u201d Johnson said. No personal data of city residents was compromised, he added. Dave Fitz, an FBI spokesman, could not be reached Wednesday. On Tuesday, Fitz said the agency was aware of the breach and providing assistance to the city, but otherwise declined to comment. The attack infiltrated a server that runs the city\u2019s computer-aided dispatch, or CAD, system for 911 and 311 calls. The system automatically populates 911 callers\u2019 locations on maps and dispatches the closest emergency responders there more seamlessly than is possible with manual dispatching. It also relays information to first responders in some cases and logs information for data retention and records. The breach shut down the CAD system from Sunday morning until Monday morning, forcing the city to revert to manual dispatching during that time. While the city\u2019s 911 calls are normally recorded online on Open Baltimore, the city dispatch logs stopped recording them at 9:54 a.m. Sunday and didn\u2019t resume recording them again until 7:42 a.m. Monday. Johnson said the attack was made possible after a city information technology team troubleshooting a separate communications issue with the server inadvertently changed a firewall and left a port, or a channel to the Internet, open for about 24 hours, and hackers who were likely running automated scans of networks looking for such vulnerabilities found it and gained access. The Baltimore hack comes amid increasing hacking of municipal systems across the country, and follows one in Atlanta last week that paralyzed that city\u2019s online bill-payment system, with hackers demanding a $51,000 payment in bitcoin to unlock it. That attack occurred Thursday, and Atlanta employees only turned their computers back on Tuesday. Johnson said his office works diligently to prevent cyberattacks and is looking to invest more in safeguarding its networks. Baltimore also faced cyberattacks during the unrest in 2015, when its website was taken offline. Johnson said he was unaware of any other successful attacks on the city\u2019s networks. He said the city would be obligated to disclose any attacks that compromised residents\u2019 personal information, health information or crime data. Johnson said he feels the city recovered well from the breach once it was identified, but that he did not want to go into detail about what was done lest he expose the city to more attacks. The city has a $2.5 million contract with TriTech Software Systems to maintain its CAD software and provide \u201ctechnical support services to ensure the functional integrity\u201d of the city\u2019s CAD system. Scott MacDonald, TriTech\u2019s vice president of public safety strategy, said the company worked with city IT personnel to shut down the CAD software after the attack. The breach was not related to the company\u2019s software, MacDonald said. \u201cOur techs connected and worked with the IT staff there, and the CAD system was taken down manually, in combination between our staff and theirs, while the servers could be troubleshooted by the city.\u201d", "sourcefile": "10112.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index":
