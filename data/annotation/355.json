{"content": "A breach of the Clash of Clans creator has exposed credentials for forum users. Supercell, the force behind that popular mobile game and others, said that a vulnerability in the software it uses to run its forums allowed third-party hackers to gain illegal access to some forum user information, including a number of emails and encrypted passwords. To provide its forum service, it uses software from vbulletin.com. The company said that its preliminary investigation suggests that the breach happened in September 2016\u2014and that it has since been fixed. \u201cWe take any such breaches very seriously and we follow very strict policies when it comes to security,\u201d Supercell said in a statement. \u201cPlease note that this breach only affects our Forum service. Game accounts have not been affected.\u201d Avast Threat Labs senior malware analyst Jan Sirmer commented via email on the danger of attacks like these. \u201cThe forum administrators in this case do bear some responsibility\u2014the vBulletin software being used to host the Supercell forum was out-of-date, and it\u2019s up to the administrators to keep software like that up-to-date,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline gamers are vulnerable to these kind of hacks because they provide their data to third parties\u2014but the same is true for everyone who uses any online service.\u201d Users should change the password they\u2019re using on the forum as soon as possible, along with the password in any other systems they\u2019re using with the same login. \u201cThe information the hackers obtained can either be used by the hackers themselves or sold on the darknet for other hackers to abuse,\u201d Sirmir said. \u201cAs many people use the same login credentials to log in to online services, hackers try to use login credentials they get to gain access into other accounts.\u201d", "sourcefile": "355.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1486, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 1494, "text": "obtained"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 1485, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1478, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "information", "endOffset": 1473, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1462, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "sold on the darknet", "endOffset": 1562, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Selling", "confidence": 0.854520857334137}, "startOffset": 1543, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "used by the hackers", "endOffset": 1528, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Gathering data", "confidence": 0.84584179520607}, "startOffset": 1509, "type": "Purpose"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 145, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 149, "text": "said"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q1438774"}, "endOffset": 89, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Supercell", "startOffset": 80, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "vulnerability", "endOffset": 170, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 157, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q341"}, "endOffset": 186, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "software", "startOffset": 178, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "gain illegal access to some forum user information", "endOffset": 294, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Privilege Abuse", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9389754235744476}, "startOffset": 244, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1731, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1742, "text": "gain access"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "accounts", "endOffset": 1762, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1754, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "use login credentials", "endOffset": 1718, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Privilege Abuse", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9049535989761353}, "startOffset": 1697, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 1689, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1682, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Clash of Clans Maker Hacked", "date": "2017_01_24", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/clash-of-clans-maker-hacked/"}}
