{"content": "PGA of America computers were infected this week with a strain of malicious software that locked down critical files and demanded cryptocurrency for their return. Officials discovered on Tuesday that servers had been targeted in a ransomware attack that  blocked them from obtaining access to material relating to major golf tournaments, including this week\u2019s PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club. Some signage had been in development for over a year and could not be reproduced quickly, Golfweek reported. The extortion threat was clear: Transfer bitcoin to the hackers or lose the files forever. \u201cYour network has been penetrated. All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorythm (sic),\u201d a ransom read. \u201cBackups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.\u201d The note claimed shutting down the system may damage files. The notice included a bitcoin wallet number\u2014where funds could be sent\u2014and a warning that there was no way to get access to the files without a decryption key. The hackers that said they would prove their \u201chonest intentions\u201d to the PGA of America by unlocking two files free-of-charge. A source who asked not to be named told Golfweek that officials had no intention of paying the ransom demand\u2014following the advice of most law enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts. The network remained locked on Wednesday and external researchers are still investigating. PGA of America has declined to comment. The golfing association did not reveal what ransomware infected its computers. But tech website Bleeping Computer found the demand matched the BitPaymer variant. Researcher Lawrence Abrams said one previous extortion scheme asked for 53 bitcoins, equivalent to $335,000. Abrams described BitPaymer as a \u201csecure ransomware\u201d and said the PGA would either have to rely on backups to regain access to its files or pay the significant bitcoin demand.", "sourcefile": "10020.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 121, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 129, "text": "demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "locked down critical files", "endOffset": 116, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9117193818092346}, "startOffset": 90, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "computers", "endOffset": 24, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 15, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "malicious software", "endOffset": 84, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 66, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "this week", "endOffset": 48, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 39, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T22", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q6435348"}, "endOffset": 3, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "PGA", "startOffset": 0, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T21", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q30"}, "endOffset": 14, "role": {"type": "Place"}, "text": "America", "startOffset": 7, "type": "GPE"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E8", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 231, "index": "T18", "endOffset": 248, "text": "ransomware attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T19", "text": "servers", "endOffset": 207, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 200, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T20", "text": "blocked them from obtaining access to material", "endOffset": 301, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9150849878787994}, "startOffset": 255, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 513, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 533, "text": "The extortion threat"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "the hackers", "endOffset": 576, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 565, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "Transfer bitcoin", "endOffset": 561, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 545, "type": "PaymentMethod"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1248, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 1272, "text": "paying the ransom demand"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "officials", "endOffset": 1227, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1218, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1896, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 1899, "text": "pay"}, "argument": [{"index": "T13", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q1771323"}, "endOffset": 1825, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "the PGA", "startOffset": 1818, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 1924, "index": "T15", "endOffset": 1930, "text": "demand"}, "index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1710, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1719, "text": "asked for"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "53 bitcoins", "endOffset": 1731, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 1720, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "$335,000", "endOffset": 1755, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 1747, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 1693, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1702, "text": "extortion"}, "index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Hackers Infect PGA Computers with Ransomware, Demand Bitcoin Payment", "date": "2018_08_09", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/ransomware-infects-pga-computers-and-locks-files-demands-bitcoin-1065038"}}
