{"content": "THE Irish public are being warned by an antivirus protection company as cyber scammers are targeting Tesco and Bank of Ireland customers. ESET Ireland have looked at recent cyber threats arriving by mail in recent weeks, and they are advising caution as one link could see your money stolen. The cyber security company say that for the people sending these malicious emails, it\u2019s a numbers game that they are playing. IT security and cybercrime analyst for ESET Ireland, Urban Schrott, said: \"Send out enough spam and a certain percentage of victims will click. So, week after week, we\u2019re seeing new scams or new variations on old scams. The past weeks were no exception.\" One such email that was sent out this week was targeted at Tesco Bank customers - the elaborate letter pretended to have come from the Tesco Bank credit card team. It reads: \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to contact you about your account, but we've been unable to reach you. Your account has been restricted. To continue using our online services and have your account restored, just to keep you safe, kindly confirm your identity and remove your account limitations with the reference link below.\u201d They would then proceed to kindly steal your log in details and try to log into your account to take your money. Bank of Ireland customers are also being targeted and ESET say that the Irish bank is \"always a popular name to abuse\". The company have detected two phishing variations which have recently targeted members of the banking institution. One convincing looking email claims: \u201cIn order to protect your funds and information, Bank of Ireland has set up a new enhanced security system, which will eliminate fraud and totally protect you. The new system is called Boi Secure Link. Click the Boi Secure Link below to enjoy the new security features.\u201d Of course, clicking on that link does everything but protect you, but instead attempts pretty much the same as the Tesco one. The second one was even simpler, but unfortunately, not less effective. It said: \u201cMy Inbox (1) ~ Your message is available to view on 365 online. Log in to 365Online\u201d. As curiosity tends to get the better of people, a \u201cnew message in the inbox\u201d is a good lure to get people clicking. ESET Ireland recommends you avoid clicking on any links in such emails and do not open attachments, as they may contain malware that can end up installing ransomware, or can lead to phishing or scamming websites.", "sourcefile": "2168.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 693, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 705, "text": "was sent out"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "email", "endOffset": 687, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 682, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "this week", "endOffset": 715, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 706, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "Tesco Bank customers", "endOffset": 752, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 732, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 776, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 803, "text": "pretended to have come from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "Tesco Bank credit card team", "endOffset": 835, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 808, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1424, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 1432, "text": "phishing"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "members", "endOffset": 1480, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1473, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "banking institution", "endOffset": 1507, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1488, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2409, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 2417, "text": "phishing"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "installing ransomware", "endOffset": 2392, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Malware spreading", "confidence": 0.8512273728847504}, "startOffset": 2371, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "clicking on any links", "endOffset": 2282, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8490641117095947}, "startOffset": 2261, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "open attachments", "endOffset": 2325, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8645743429660797}, "startOffset": 2309, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "emails", "endOffset": 2297, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 2291, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "scamming websites", "endOffset": 2438, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 2421, "type": "Website"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 343, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 350, "text": "sending"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "malicious emails", "endOffset": 373, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 357, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q9685"}, "endOffset": 342, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "text": "the people", "startOffset": 332, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1195, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1200, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T13", "text": "take your money", "endOffset": 1272, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Monetary", "confidence": 0.9171864688396454}, "startOffset": 1257, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "your log in details", "endOffset": 1220, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1201, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "They", "endOffset": 1165, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1161, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Irish public warned as cyber scammers target Tesco and Bank of Ireland customers", "date": "2017_05_09", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.thesun.ie/news/968499/irish-public-warned-as-email-cyber-scammers-target-tesco-and-bank-of-ireland-customers/"}}
