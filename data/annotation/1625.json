{"content": "In the wake of a weekend cyber attack, ECMC officials say the hospital\u2019s IT staff discovered the virus and shut down the hospital\u2019s computer network, before it could infect their files. ECMC spokesman Peter Cutler said, State Police and the FBI are investigating. \u201cWe do know that a virus was launched into our system and the good news, again, is that we reacted to it immediately.\u201d With the medical center\u2019s computer network still offline, ECMC is conducting business the old fashioned way, on paper\u2014no website, no email\u2014and Cutler says they don\u2019t believe patient files were compromised in any way. \u201cThrough the assessments that we have been running, we have seen no indication that there has been a compromise of patient health information.\u201d Investigators would not say how hackers attacked ECMC\u2019s computers, but authorities in the field of cyber security say, this attempted intrusion has all the hallmarks of ransomware. University at Buffalo cyber security expert Arun Vishwanath says ransomware attacks have grown exponentially in the last two years, and likens them to Internet extortion. \u201cThey are very successful, and so that is why we are seeing an exponential growth in ransomware attacks. We are talking about somewhere between 5,000 attacks per day that are reported\u2013let alone the ones that are not even reported.\u201d Vishwanath says ransomware attacks are big reward low risk ventures, since the hackers are usually from other countries, and rarely get caught. Unwitting victims download an infected attachment from an email and the virus spreads quickly. \u201cThe moment you click on the malware, this malware basically locks down your computer, and all the files in it, and any file that is connected to any other computer that you are connected to. So this can spread through your network in minutes.\u201d The hacker then demands the target pay a ransom to get their files unencrypted, and in just about every ransomware attack, the hackers cover their tracks by demanding payment in bitcoin\u2013a virtual currency that is hard, if not impossible to trace. Once the ransom is paid, the hackers send their victim an electronic key to unlock their encrypted files, but if the payment is not made within a certain time frame the hacked files are lost forever.", "sourcefile": "1625.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1828, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1835, "text": "demands"}, "argument": [{"index": "T13", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hacker", "wikidataid": "Q279213"}, "endOffset": 1822, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "text": "The hacker", "startOffset": 1812, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E8", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1847, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 1859, "text": "pay a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "text": "the target", "endOffset": 1846, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1836, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 571, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 587, "text": "were compromised"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "patient files", "endOffset": 570, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 557, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "they", "endOffset": 542, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 538, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 690, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 711, "text": "has been a compromise"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "patient health information", "endOffset": 741, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 715, "type": "PII"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1916, "index": "T15", "endOffset": 1933, "text": "ransomware attack"}, "index": "E9", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1344, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1362, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 4, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 990, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 1008, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "the last two years", "endOffset": 1055, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1037, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 5, "events": [{"index": "E10", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1969, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 1986, "text": "demanding payment"}, "argument": [{"index": "T18", "text": "in bitcoin", "endOffset": 1997, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 1987, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "the hackers", "endOffset": 1946, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1935, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 6, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1076, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 1094, "text": "Internet extortion"}, "index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 7, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1181, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1199, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 8, "events": [{"index": "E11", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2064, "index": "T19", "endOffset": 2082, "text": "the ransom is paid"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "the hackers", "endOffset": 2095, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2084, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "their victim", "endOffset": 2113, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2101, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Patient files so far okay after ECMC cyber attack | wivb.com", "date": "2017_04_12", "type": "text", "link": "http://wivb.com/2017/04/11/patient-files-so-far-okay-after-ecmc-cyber-attack/"}}
