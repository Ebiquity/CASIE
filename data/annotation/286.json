{"content": "The executive director of the organization revealed on Tuesday that their\u00a0computer systems have been infected with a\u00a0ransomware\u00a0by cyber criminals who\u00a0happen to be \u201can international cyber terrorist organization\u201d. Aimee Fant, the Executive Director of Little Red Door, officially revealed its involvement in the agency\u2019s computer system hack in a press release. According to their Facebook post,\u00a0the attack occurred last week on Wednesday night when the hackers attacked the terminal service and backup driver of Cancer Services\u2019 computer systems. They managed to access, hack and encrypt the data. After carrying out the hack attack, the notorious gang of cyber criminals demanded $43,000 ransom on Thursday. The press release also revealed that the perpetrators of the crime were gearing up to threaten the family members of living or deceased \u201ccancer clients, donors and community partners\u201d. She further informed that the FBI has been contacted to conduct an \u201cactive investigation\u201d. It is worth noting that a majority of the agency\u2019s data is stored in cloud storage. Perhaps, this is why the organization is not willing to pay the ransom and believes that \u201call funds raised must go to serving families, all stage cancer patients, late stage care/hospice support and preventative screenings,\u201d instead of cyber criminals.", "sourcefile": "286.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 672, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 680, "text": "demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "Thursday", "endOffset": 707, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 699, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "$43,000", "endOffset": 688, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 681, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "cyber criminals", "endOffset": 671, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 656, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "the hack attack", "endOffset": 632, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Interception", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9011393189430237}, "startOffset": 617, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1125, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 1139, "text": "pay the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q1071976"}, "endOffset": 1106, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "the organization", "startOffset": 1090, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 689, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 695, "text": "ransom"}, "index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Cyber Criminals Held Cancer Services Computers for Ransom", "date": "2017_01_20", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.hackread.com/cancer-services-computers-for-ransom/"}}
