{"content": "After a week of being bruised and battered over elevated reputation and credit risks, the last thing the bankers attending The Australian Financial Review Banking and Wealth Summit needed was a reminder of the rising operational risks from cyber attacks. But the straight-shooting chief executive of Insurance Australia Group, Peter Harmer, did not dodge the question when asked what his firm had found while trawling through the \"dark web\". He said IAG had uncovered the personal details of customers belonging to one of the big four banks. The information was being sold online for $25 per customer. That suggests the systems of at least one major financial institution have been breached and customer data stolen. Harmer was primed for this conversation about cyber risks at the Summit. On Wednesday he had led the IAG board of directors on a tour of the company's cyber-security facility in Sydney. He said any chief executive who believes they have a secure digital environment is \"completely oblivious to the threats that are out there\". \"We trawl our systems all the time looking for unusual activity,\" he said. \"We trawl the dark net looking for where our data might be up for sale, and it's amazing when you actually see what is being offered for sale. All we've found is a couple of our employees' names and addresses, so our view is that we are reasonably confident with the analysis, and being able to thwart the hackers coming into our system.\" Harmer's most worrying revelation was that the global capacity for cyber protection was a measly $500 million. He said for a business such as IAG, which has a market capitalisation of $14 billion, this amount of insurance \"would not even touch the sides\". This made it imperative for companies to invest in defence efforts and avoid any major extraction of data by cyber attackers. On Wednesday, bankers attending the summit were reminded of the lack of trust in the community towards financial institutions.", "sourcefile": "1529.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 695, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 715, "text": "customer data stolen"}, "index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Databreach", "realis": "Generic"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 672, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 690, "text": "have been breached"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q650241"}, "endOffset": 671, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "at least one major financial institution", "startOffset": 631, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "the systems", "endOffset": 627, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 616, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "The information was being sold online", "endOffset": 579, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Publish data", "confidence": 0.843766838312149}, "startOffset": 542, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "the personal details", "endOffset": 488, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 468, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "customers", "endOffset": 501, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 492, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q2088611"}, "endOffset": 540, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "banks", "startOffset": 535, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1801, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1819, "text": "extraction of data"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "cyber attackers", "endOffset": 1838, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1823, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "IAG CEO Peter Harmer blows the whistle on cyber risk  | afr.com", "date": "2017_04_07", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/iag-ceo-peter-harmer-blows-the-whistle-on-cyber-risk-20170406-gvfcu6"}}
