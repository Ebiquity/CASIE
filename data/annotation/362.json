{"content": "The first reported instance of a cyber attack on a utilities provider will happen this year. That\u2019s according to Perry Stoneman, Global Head of Utilities at consulting firm Capgemini, who told ELN it would likely take the form of a\u00a0ransomware attack. This is\u00a0when computer\u00a0systems are hacked by criminals\u00a0who\u00a0then demand a sum of money to avoid a major city having its power cut off. Mr Stoneman believes the\u00a0hackers would want their attack to be\u00a0\u201cvisible, attention-catching and\u00a0newsworthy\u201d \u2013 turning the lights out is just that. He said: \u201cIt could be something more malicious than just wanting money. Mr Stoneman\u00a0told ELN although the risks do increase as\u00a0energy systems become more dependent on technology, the\u00a0main reason the threat is growing is because there are\u00a0larger numbers of hackers with more advanced skills than ever before.", "sourcefile": "362.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 232, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 249, "text": "ransomware attack"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 314, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 320, "text": "demand"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "criminals", "endOffset": 304, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 295, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "a major city", "endOffset": 357, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 345, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "computer\u00a0systems are hacked", "endOffset": 291, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.907480001449585}, "startOffset": 264, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "a sum of money", "endOffset": 335, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 321, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "having its power cut off", "endOffset": 382, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9121898710727692}, "startOffset": 358, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Energy Live News \u2013 Energy Made Easy   \u2013 \u2018First utility cyber attack will happen this year\u2019", "date": "2017_01_26", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.energylivenews.com/2017/01/25/first-utility-cyber-attack-will-happen-this-year/"}}
