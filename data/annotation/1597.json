{"content": "Regulators and medical-device-makers are bracing for an expected barrage of hacking attacks even as legal and technical uncertainties leave them in uncharted territory. Tens of millions of electronic health records have been compromised in recent years, a number that is growing and, some say, underreported. High-profile attacks have hit hospitals and health insurers, and now attention is turning to a new vulnerability: medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become increasingly concerned about the issue and is working to coordinate with other agencies on how to respond if a serious medical device hack were to occur. There have been rumblings over cybersecurity for years. More than 113 million personal health records were compromised in 2015, according to provider data reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), nine times as many as in 2014. Last fall, Johnson & Johnson had to tell its customers that its insulin pumps had a security vulnerability that hackers could use to access the device and cause a potentially fatal overdose of insulin. \"In just the last few years, we've seen more than a hundred million health records of American citizens breached in a couple of well-publicized incidents,\" Terry Rice, vice president of IT risk management and chief information security officer at Merck & Company, told the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last week.", "sourcefile": "1597.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 780, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 796, "text": "were compromised"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "113 million", "endOffset": 755, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Data"}, "startOffset": 744, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "personal health records", "endOffset": 779, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 756, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "2015", "endOffset": 804, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 800, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 215, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 236, "text": "have been compromised"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "recent years", "endOffset": 252, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 240, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "electronic health records", "endOffset": 214, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 189, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "Tens of millions", "endOffset": 185, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 169, "type": "Number"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1233, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 1241, "text": "breached"}, "argument": [{"index": "T16", "text": "American citizens", "endOffset": 1232, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1215, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "health records", "endOffset": 1211, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1197, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "a hundred million", "endOffset": 1196, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Data"}, "startOffset": 1179, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "last few years", "endOffset": 1156, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1142, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 956, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 967, "text": "had to tell"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnson_&_Johnson", "wikidataid": "Q333718"}, "endOffset": 955, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Johnson & Johnson", "startOffset": 938, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "Last fall", "endOffset": 936, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 927, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "its insulin pumps", "endOffset": 1004, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 987, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "a security vulnerability", "endOffset": 1033, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1009, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "hackers could use to access the device", "endOffset": 1077, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.8902558982372284}, "startOffset": 1039, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "FDA, industry fear wave of medical-device hacks | TheHill", "date": "2017_04_11", "type": "text", "link": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/328120-fda-industry-fear-wave-of-medical-device-hacks"}}
