{"content": "An Android SMS-based spyware dubbed SMSVova, which can steal and relay a victim's location to an attacker in real time, has been downloaded between one and five million times since 2014 from the US Google Play store. Zscaler ThreatLabz found that the app claimed to give users access to the latest Android software updates, but in fact was being used to spy on a user\u2019s exact geolocation, which could have been used for any number of malicious reasons. Despite clear red flags, millions downloaded it. \u201cThe app portrays itself as a \u2018System Update,\u2019\u201d the firm\u2019s researchers explained, in a blog. \u201cAfter reading the app reviews, it became clear that several users were misled by the app, thinking that it would provide them with latest Android release. Many users were unhappy with the app and conveyed their concerns.\u201d In addition to the negative reviews, there were other indicators that raised suspicions: The Google Play Store page for this particular app was showing blank screenshots, which is not common, and there was no proper description for the app. It also didn\u2019t mention that it would track the victim, nor that it would send location information to a third party. It said only, \u201cThis application updates and enables special location features.\u201d \u201cThere are many spyware variations present on the Google Play store, such as Cell Tracker, but the legitimate apps are explicit in their intentions, and have specific purposes for tracking a user\u2019s device,\u201d Zscaler researchers noted. As soon as the user tries to start up the app, it abruptly quits and hides itself from the main screen. From there, it sets up an Android service and broadcast receiver to fetch the user\u2019s last known location and set it up in Shared Preferences. An attacker could also set a location alert when victim\u2019s battery is running low. Interestingly, the code is a carbon copy of the location-stealing code in DroidJack, the remote access trojan. \u201cThere are many apps on the Google Play Store that act as a spyware; for example, those that spy on the SMS messages of one\u2019s spouse or fetch the location of children for concerned parents,\u201d researchers said. \u201cBut those apps explicitly state their purpose, which is not the case with the app we analyzed for this report. It portrayed itself as a system update, misleading users into thinking they were downloading an Android System Update.\u201d Google has removed the app from the store since Zscaler reported it to the Google security team.", "sourcefile": "1778.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2253, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 2272, "text": "portrayed itself as"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "system update", "endOffset": 2288, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 2275, "type": "Software"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2290, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 2300, "text": "misleading"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "users", "endOffset": 2306, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2301, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q79576"}, "endOffset": 2367, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "Android System Update", "startOffset": 2346, "type": "Software"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 55, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 60, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "attacker", "endOffset": 105, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 97, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "victim", "endOffset": 79, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 73, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "location", "endOffset": 90, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 82, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "SMSVova", "endOffset": 43, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 36, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "An Android SMS-based spyware", "endOffset": 28, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 255, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 262, "text": "claimed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "the app", "endOffset": 254, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 247, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "users", "endOffset": 276, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 271, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T16", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q79576"}, "endOffset": 314, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "the latest Android software", "startOffset": 287, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "spy on a user\u2019s exact geolocation", "endOffset": 387, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Publish data", "confidence": 0.7709209620952606}, "startOffset": 354, "type": "Purpose"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Android SMS Spyware Sees Millions of Downloads", "date": "2017_04_20", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/android-sms-spyware-sees-millions/"}}
