{"content": "Further ReadingStepson of Stuxnet stalked Kaspersky for months, tapped Iran nuke talksTwo years ago, researchers at Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab discovered their corporate network was infected with malware that was unlike anything they had ever seen. Virtually all of the malware resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, a feat that had allowed the infection to remain undetected for six months or more. Kaspersky eventually unearthed evidence that Duqu 2.0, as the never-before-seen malware was dubbed, was derived from Stuxnet, the highly sophisticated computer worm reportedly created by the US and Israel to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The Kaspersky Lab researchers still don't know if a single group of individuals is behind the attacks, or if they're being carried out by competing hacker gangs. The use of the fileless malware and command-server domains that aren't associated with any whois data makes the already difficult task of attribution almost impossible. The researchers first discovered the malware late last year, when a bank's security team found a copy of Meterpreter\u2014an in-memory component of Metasploit\u2014residing inside the physical memory of a Microsoft domain controller. After conducting a forensic analysis, the researchers found that the Meterpreter code was downloaded and injected into memory using PowerShell commands. The infected machine also used Microsoft's NETSH networking tool to transport data to attacker-controlled servers. To obtain the administrative privileges necessary to do these things, the attackers also relied on Mimikatz. To reduce the evidence left in logs or hard drives, the attackers stashed the PowerShell commands into the Windows registry. Fortunately, the evidence on the domain controller was intact, presumably because it hadn't been restarted before Kaspersky Lab researchers began their investigation. An analysis of the dumped memory contents and the Windows registries allowed the researchers to restore the Meterpreter and Mimikatz code. The attackers, the researchers later determined, had used the tools to collect passwords of system administrators and for the remote administration of infected host machines.", "sourcefile": "564.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1270, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 1275, "text": "found"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "the researchers", "endOffset": 1269, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 1254, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "the Meterpreter code", "endOffset": 1301, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1281, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "was downloaded and injected into memory using PowerShell commands", "endOffset": 1367, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "File Manipulation", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.8986548781394958}, "startOffset": 1302, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2095, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 2102, "text": "collect"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "The attackers", "endOffset": 2037, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2024, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "passwords", "endOffset": 2112, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 2103, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "system administrators", "endOffset": 2137, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2116, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "infected host machines", "endOffset": 2197, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Configuration/Environment Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8593783378601074}, "startOffset": 2175, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "A rash of invisible, fileless malware is infecting banks around the globe | Ars Technica", "date": "2017_02_09", "type": "text", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/02/a-rash-of-invisible-fileless-malware-is-infecting-banks-around-the-globe/"}}
