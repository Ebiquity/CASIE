{"content": "A Boeing employee inadvertently leaked the personal information of 36,000 of his co-workers late last year when he emailed a company spreadsheet to his non-Boeing spouse. Forty-seven states, including Washington, have legislation on the books that requires companies or government entities to disclose whenever there\u2019s been a breach of personally identifiable information. Under Washington law, companies are required to notify the Attorney General\u2019s office if the incident affects more than 500 of the state\u2019s residents. In this instance Boeing claims the information of 7,288 Washington residents may have been impacted. According to the letter, the breach occurred on Nov.\u00a021, 2016 after a Boeing employee encountered a formatting issue and emailed a spreadsheet to his spouse who didn\u2019t work at the company. The file contained sensitive, personally identifiable information of 36,000 of the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s employees. The file included the names, places of birth, BEMSID, or employee ID numbers, and accounting department codes. The spreadsheet also included Social security numbers and dates of birth, albeit in \u201chidden columns,\u201d according to Olson. Spreadsheet software, such as\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Excel, usually allows authors to make select information hidden, usually to prevent that data from being seen, changed, or deleted. According to Olson\u2019s letter, the breach was discovered earlier this year, on Jan.\u00a09, but the company didn\u2019t begin to inform employees until a month later, Feb.\u00a08. In the letter to Ferguson, Boeing claims it destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and carried out a \u201cforensic examination\u201d of both the Boeing employee\u2019s computer and his spouse\u2019s to ensure it was deleted. \u201cBoth the employee and his spouse have confirmed to us that they have not distributed or used any of the information,\u201d Olson writes. For its part, Boeing, the second largest defense contractor in the world after Lockheed Martin, said it doesn\u2019t believe its employee\u2019s data has been or will be used inappropriately.", "sourcefile": "811.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 32, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 38, "text": "leaked"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "A Boeing employee", "endOffset": 17, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "the personal information", "endOffset": 63, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 39, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "36,000", "endOffset": 73, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 67, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "his co-workers", "endOffset": 91, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 77, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "late last year", "endOffset": 106, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 92, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 648, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 658, "text": "the breach"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "Nov.\u00a021, 2016", "endOffset": 684, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 671, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1366, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1376, "text": "the breach"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "Jan.\u00a09", "endOffset": 1420, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1414, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 319, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 332, "text": "been a breach"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "personally identifiable information", "endOffset": 371, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 336, "type": "PII"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Boeing Notifies 36,000 Employees Following Breach | Threatpost | The first stop for security news", "date": "2017_02_28", "type": "text", "link": "https://threatpost.com/boeing-notifies-36000-employees-following-breach/123942/"}}
