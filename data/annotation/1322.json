{"content": "On March 25, security researcher Kevin Beaumont discovered something very\u00a0unfortunate on Docs.com, Microsoft's free document-sharing site tied to the company's Office 365 service: its homepage had a search bar. That in itself would not have been a problem if Office 2016 and Office 365 users were aware that the documents they were posting were being shared publicly. As described in a Microsoft support document, \"with Docs.com, you can create an online portfolio of your expertise, discover, download, or bookmark works from other authors, and build your brand with built-in SEO, analytics, and email and social sharing.\" But many users used Docs.com to either share documents within their organizations or to pass them to people outside their organizations\u2014unaware that the data was being indexed by search engines. And many of the documents are still discoverable on the Google or Bing search engines, as they had been publicly indexed. That means that until the documents are unpublished from Docs.com, they will continue to be accessible to anyone who searches against the site. Microsoft had previously published a notice on security fixes to Docs.com for Office 365 administrators, advising them on how to control access by users to the service. \"Because Docs.com does not yet meet all of Office 365 compliance framework requirements, Office 365 and Azure Tenant administrators must 'opt-in' to enable users with organizational accounts to use the service,\" the Microsoft Support document states. It's not clear how recently that change was made; Ars has reached out to Microsoft for further comment. Update 10:30 AM ET: This morning, Microsoft disabled some searched on Docs.com, and is blocking some incoming links to searches from Google. But additional documents were discoverable via Google search, including documents with health benefits information filled in", "sourcefile": "1322.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1132, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 1146, "text": "security fixes"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q5287259"}, "endOffset": 1158, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "Docs.com", "startOffset": 1150, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microsoft", "wikidataid": "Q2283"}, "endOffset": 1094, "role": {"type": "Releaser"}, "text": "Microsoft", "startOffset": 1085, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 48, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 58, "text": "discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q5287259"}, "endOffset": 97, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "Docs.com", "startOffset": 89, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Beaumont", "wikidataid": "Q313932"}, "endOffset": 47, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "security researcher Kevin Beaumont", "startOffset": 13, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "March 25", "endOffset": 11, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 3, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Doxed by Microsoft\u2019s Docs.com: Users unwittingly shared sensitive docs publicly | Ars Technica", "date": "2017_03_28", "type": "text", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/doxed-by-microsofts-docs-com-users-unwittingly-shared-sensitive-docs-publicly/"}}
