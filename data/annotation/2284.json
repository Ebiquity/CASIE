{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser said Monday that the malware that has infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries is \u201cin the wild,\u201d but so far has not infiltrated U.S. government systems. Tom Bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said three variants of the malware have been discovered and the U.S. government was closely monitoring the situation with officials in Britain. \u201cOverall, the U.S. infection rate has been lower than many parts of the world, but we may still see significant impacts in additional networks as these malware attacks morph and change,\u201d Bossert told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe had a small number of affected parties in the U.S., including FedEx. As of today, no federal systems are affected.\u201d Computers across the world were locked up Friday and users\u2019 files held for ransom when dozens of countries were hit in a cyber-extortion attack that targeted hospitals, companies and government agencies. Cybersecurity experts say the unknown hackers who launched the \u201cransomware\u201d attacks used a hole in Microsoft software that was discovered by the National Security Agency and exposed when NSA documents were leaked online. The Department of Homeland Security is taking the lead on the investigation in the United States. The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center is keeping the U.S. government informed about classified information concerning the investigation, he said. If Americans follow the patching information issued by the FBI, Microsoft and the Homeland Security Department, they will be protected from the malware and the variants, Bossert said. \u201cWhile it would be satisfying to hold accountable those responsible for this hack \u2014 something that we are working on quite seriously \u2014 the worm is in the wild, so to speak at this point, and patching is the most important message as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite appearing to be criminal activity intended to raise money, it appears that less than $70,000 has been paid in ransoms and we are not aware of payments that have led to any data recovery.\u201d Neither the FBI or NSA would comment Monday. Trump signed an executive order on Friday aimed at boosting the nation\u2019s cybersecurity, as well as building and maintaining \u201ca modern, secure, and more resilient executive branch IT architecture.\u201d \u201cThe trend is going in the wrong direction in cyberspace, and it\u2019s time to stop that trend and reverse it on behalf of the American people,\u201d Bossert said after that signing last week. \u201cWe have seen increasing attacks from allies, adversaries, primarily nation-states, but also non-nation-state actors, and sitting by and doing nothing is no longer an option.\u201d                 Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert announces May 11 that Trump signed an executive order to bolster the government's cyber security and protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, during a news briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C.", "sourcefile": "2284.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 905, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 913, "text": "were hit"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 873, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 879, "text": "ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "users\u2019 files held", "endOffset": 868, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Shared Data Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8873287737369537}, "startOffset": 851, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "locked up", "endOffset": 839, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8783059418201447}, "startOffset": 830, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "Computers", "endOffset": 807, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 798, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "Friday", "endOffset": 846, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 840, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 919, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 941, "text": "cyber-extortion attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q16917"}, "endOffset": 965, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "hospitals", "startOffset": 956, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T8", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q257303"}, "endOffset": 976, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "companies", "startOffset": 967, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "government agencies", "endOffset": 1000, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 981, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1065, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1085, "text": "\u201cransomware\u201d attacks"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 1047, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1040, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "Microsoft software", "endOffset": 1119, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1101, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "used a hole", "endOffset": 1097, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Man in the Middle Attack", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8716966509819031}, "startOffset": 1086, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2017, "index": "T17", "endOffset": 2041, "text": "has been paid in ransoms"}, "argument": [{"index": "T18", "text": "$70,000", "endOffset": 2016, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 2009, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 2066, "index": "T19", "endOffset": 2074, "text": "payments"}, "index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1203, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 1214, "text": "were leaked"}, "argument": [{"index": "T16", "text": "documents", "endOffset": 1202, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1193, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T15", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Security_Agency", "wikidataid": "Q121194"}, "endOffset": 1192, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "NSA", "startOffset": 1189, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Cyberattack has not affected U.S. government, White House says | PBS NewsHour", "date": "2017_05_16", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/cyberattack-not-affected-u-s-government-white-house-says/"}}
