{"content": "A security vulnerability in Intel Corp. chips first disclosed last week\u00a0looks far worse than initially thought, as hackers can hijack Intel processors without even needing a password. The vulnerability, which affects all Intel chips manufactured since 2008, from those code-named Nahalem to today\u2019s Kaby Lake, stems from a flaw in vPro firmware suite including Intel Active Management Technology\u00a0from versions 6 to 11.6. The security hole allows\u00a0an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by the firmware suite, giving a would-be hacker the same access that a systems administrator would have, including the ability to change boot up code and access the computer\u2019s mouse, keyboard, monitor and programs installed. Intel\u00a0argued that access to the vulnerability was fairly limited, in that a password was required to access AMT. But Tenable Network Security Inc. has discovered that the verification process for AMT accepts a blank password submission. As Rick Falkvinge at Private Internet Access explains: In order to get administrator privileges to the server memory, all you needed to do was to submit a blank password field instead of the expected privileged-access password hash, and you would have unlimited and unlogged read/write access to the entire server memory. With the ability to gain access to an Intel central processing unit as simple as submitting no password, experts are warning that the worst should be presumed. \u201cIf you have anything connected to the Internet with AMT on, disable it now. Assume the server has already been compromised,\u201d SSH inventor Tatu Ylonen said in a blog post.\u00a0\u201cThe exploit is trivial, a maximum of five lines of Python, and could be doable in a one-line shell command.\u201d He said the flaw gives full control of affected machines, including the ability to read and modify everything. \u201cIt can be used to install persistent malware \u2013 possibly in the firmware \u2013 and read and modify any data. Ylonen recommended that AMT be disabled today and that affected users \u201cmobilize whomever you need.\u201d More specifically, he said, \u201cstart from the most critical servers: Active Directory, certificate authorities, critical databases, code signing servers, firewalls, security servers, HSMs (if they have it enabled).\u201d Data center operators should \u201cblock ports 16992, 16993, 16994, 16995, 623, 664 in internal firewalls\u201d if they can.", "sourcefile": "2144.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 52, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 61, "text": "disclosed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "last week\u00a0", "endOffset": 72, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 62, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "security vulnerability", "endOffset": 24, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 2, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "Intel Corp. chips", "endOffset": 45, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 28, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "hackers can hijack Intel processors", "endOffset": 150, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9156200289726257}, "startOffset": 115, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 209, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 216, "text": "affects"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "The vulnerability", "endOffset": 201, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 184, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "Intel chips", "endOffset": 232, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 221, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "a flaw", "endOffset": 327, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 321, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "vPro firmware", "endOffset": 344, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 331, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "Active Management Technology\u00a0", "endOffset": 396, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 367, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "since 2008", "endOffset": 256, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 246, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "versions 6", "endOffset": 411, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Version"}, "startOffset": 401, "type": "Version"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "11.6", "endOffset": 419, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Version"}, "startOffset": 415, "type": "Version"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 898, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 912, "text": "has discovered"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q55948312"}, "endOffset": 897, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Tenable Network Security Inc.", "startOffset": 868, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "AMT", "endOffset": 950, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 947, "type": "Software"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Intel chip vulnerability found to be far worse than thought - SiliconANGLE", "date": "2017_05_08", "type": "text", "link": "https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/05/07/intel-chip-vulnerability-found-far-worse-thought/"}}
