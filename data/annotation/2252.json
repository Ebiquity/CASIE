{"content": "A new variant of the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced on Monday, according to cyber security firm Check Point Software, which it said it had stopped from damaging computers by activating a \"kill switch\" in the software. The company discovered the new variant at about 7am New York time on Monday, as it was infecting computers at a rate of about one per second, said Check Point researcher Maya Horowitz. The firm responded by setting up a server that initiated what is called a kill switch built into the software, which prevents it from encrypting data on infected machines or spreading to other computers, she said. Ransomware is illicit software that demands a \"ransom\" from an infected user to regain control of their computer.", "sourcefile": "2252.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 658, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 676, "text": "demands a \"ransom\""}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q926331"}, "endOffset": 632, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "Ransomware", "startOffset": 622, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q20850624"}, "endOffset": 698, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "user", "startOffset": 694, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T7", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q68"}, "endOffset": 734, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "computer", "startOffset": 726, "type": "Device"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 17, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 47, "text": "the WannaCry ransomware attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "Monday", "endOffset": 66, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 60, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "New variant of WannaCry ransomware surfaces - Check Point - Security - Finance - CRN Australia", "date": "2017_05_16", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.crn.com.au/news/new-variant-of-wannacry-ransomware-surfaces---check-point-461856?eid=4&edate=20170516&utm_source=20170516&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=daily_newsletter"}}
