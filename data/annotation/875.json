{"content": "Researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity have unearthed an \u201cinteresting security issue\u201d involving the popular messaging app Telegram. One of the appeals of Telegram is that it has encryption options for Android and iOS, whereby it uses your contact list to prepopulate contacts inside the app. Also, when someone in your contact list signs up for Telegram, you receive a notification so you know you can contact them using the app. However, John Bambenek, threat systems manager, Fidelis Cybersecurity, revealed that the combination of these features has allowed the firm to uncover a big privacy problem. \u201cIf a scammer signs up for Telegram and already has your phone number in their contact list, it will also notify them that you have also Telegram,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in addition to connecting you to your friends and contacts, the app will also connect scammers directly to you. Likewise, if you have scammers' numbers in your contact list for some reason, you will get push notifications when they join Telegram.\u201d What\u2019s more, Bambenek explained that this issue didn\u2019t occur just once or twice, and on multiple occasions Fidelis observed phone numbers associated with telemarketing scammers signed up to use Telegram. \u201cTo complicate matters, we found no obvious way to prevent people from finding out if you are a Telegram user,\u201d he added. Further, Bambenek warned that it would not be difficult to come up with a way to find out if a phone number uses Telegram (or many of the other popular mobile messaging/voice applications, for that matter), highlighting the following as uses for this insight by third parties: Intelligence agencies consider the use of such services as a \"risk factor\" when deciding on surveillance targets. Border control officials could detect the use of such services during border crossing interviews, and conclude that the user has something to hide. Criminals could use the knowledge that a user is on such a service to target them. \u201cEncrypted messaging and voice applications create a new surface area for attacks to unfold and should not be entirely trusted,\u201d Bambenek continued. \u201cWhile these apps may be a great benefit to privacy, they shouldn\u2019t be trusted any more than unencrypted calls. These systems do protect against spoofing, but if you have unknown callers on such applications, due caution is still required.\u201d However, Chris Boyd, lead malware analyst at Malwarebytes, was quick to point out that all VoiP and regular chat apps have the ability for strangers to add you to their contact list, depending on security settings, adding: \u201cWhether people add themselves to your Telegram, Skype or even plain old Instant Messaging services, the same ground rules apply: try to ensure that they are who they say they are before revealing too much information. If in doubt, contact your associate directly using another service \u2013 just like you would if sent a \u2018stranded with no money in a foreign land\u2019 message on Facebook,\u201d he told Infosecurity.", "sourcefile": "875.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1128, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 1136, "text": "observed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q16836671"}, "endOffset": 1127, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Fidelis", "startOffset": 1120, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "telemarketing scammers signed up to use Telegram", "endOffset": 1215, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Content Spoofing", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.890261322259903}, "startOffset": 1167, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1035, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 1044, "text": "explained"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "Bambenek", "endOffset": 1034, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 1026, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "this issue", "endOffset": 1060, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1050, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 501, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 509, "text": "revealed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fidelis_Cybersecurity"}, "endOffset": 499, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Fidelis Cybersecurity", "startOffset": 478, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "threat systems manager", "endOffset": 476, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 454, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "John Bambenek", "endOffset": 452, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 439, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 573, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 580, "text": "uncover"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "big privacy problem", "endOffset": 602, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 583, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 39, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 53, "text": "have unearthed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fidelis_Cybersecurity"}, "endOffset": 38, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "text": "Fidelis Cybersecurity", "startOffset": 17, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "Researchers", "endOffset": 11, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "interesting security issue", "endOffset": 84, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 58, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "messaging app Telegram", "endOffset": 130, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 108, "type": "Software"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Privacy Issue Discovered in Telegram Messaging App", "date": "2017_03_02", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/privacy-issue-telegram-messaging/"}}
