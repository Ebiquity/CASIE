{"content": "Trade-off between security and usability unlikely to permit systematic surveillance, experts say \u2022 This article was originally published on 13 January 2017. It has been extensively amended (see endnotes) following a review by the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor. A design feature that could potentially allow some encrypted messages to reach unintended recipients is present within the WhatsApp messaging service. Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which has about one billion users, has not made it widely known that there is an aspect of WhatsApp that results in some messages being re-encrypted and resent automatically, without first giving the sender an opportunity to verify the recipient. Campaigners have expressed concern about how this aspect of WhatsApp could potentially be exploited to conduct surveillance. WhatsApp has made privacy and security a primary selling point, and has become a go-to communications tool of activists, dissidents and diplomats. Its end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys using the acclaimed Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems. Keys are exchanged between users to guarantee communications are secure from interception by middlemen. The way WhatsApp implemented the protocol, new keys are generated when \u2013 for example \u2013 a user gets a new phone or reinstalls the app. Messages for the user which may have been waiting to be delivered while the user was offline are then re-encrypted and resent by the sender automatically, without the sender having had an opportunity to verify that the recipient is the person intended to receive the message. A sender is notified after the event if the sender has opted to turn on a notification in settings, but not otherwise. This aspect of WhatsApp, which increases convenience and reliability of message delivery at the cost of some security, is not inherent to the Signal protocol. If a recipient\u2019s security key changes while offline, an in-transit message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without the message having been resent automatically.", "sourcefile": "193.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 768, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 780, "text": "be exploited"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "conduct surveillance", "endOffset": 804, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Excavation", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9103391170501709}, "startOffset": 784, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 693, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 715, "text": "have expressed concern"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "this aspect", "endOffset": 737, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 726, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "Campaigners", "endOffset": 692, "role": {"type": "Discoverer"}, "startOffset": 681, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/WhatsApp"}, "endOffset": 749, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "WhatsApp", "startOffset": 741, "type": "System"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 359, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 369, "text": "is present"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/WhatsApp"}, "endOffset": 407, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "the WhatsApp messaging service", "startOffset": 377, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "allow some encrypted messages", "endOffset": 327, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "File Manipulation", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9204060733318329}, "startOffset": 298, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "A design feature", "endOffset": 274, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 258, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "WhatsApp design feature means some encrypted messages could be read by third party | Technology | The Guardian", "date": "2017_01_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages"}}
