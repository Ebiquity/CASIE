{"content": "Rick Wang, an official with Taiwan\u2019s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), said each brokerage had received an email setting a deadline for the transfer of funds to avoid a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. They have become common tools for cyber criminals trying to cripple businesses and organizations with significant online activities. \u201cWe have never seen this on such a scale - five companies hit at one time with the same threat,\u201d said Wang, adding that the regulator usually sees single instances of cyber-crime. FireEye, a cybersecurity consultancy, said the attacks were similar to a wave of threatened denial of service attacks by a previously unidentified group that first appeared in Europe last month. The Taiwan attacks do not pose a threat to the island\u2019s broader trading and financial system, Wang said, but he added that the regulator had asked all securities firms to step up defensive measures. \u201cThe emails were sent under the name of the \u2018Armada Collective\u2019,\u201d said Chiu Shao-chou, an official of the internet cybercrime division of Taiwan\u2019s Criminal Investigation Bureau, the government\u2019s top investigation body. The Armada Collective, a hacking extortion group, has been linked to financial blackmail heists elsewhere. But Chiu said the group has been put under watch and Taiwan investigators were still looking into the original source of the emails. The email demanded payment in web-based digital currency bitcoin equivalent to about T$300,000 ($9,731.41), Taiwan media said. None of the securities companies made any payments, Chiu said. Another brokerage firm, Capital Securities Corp, was hit on Monday by a DDoS attack lasting 20 minutes before its system recovered, the regulator said, but it did not link the latest case to the threatening emails", "sourcefile": "523.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1396, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1412, "text": "demanded payment"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "T$300,000", "endOffset": 1480, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 1471, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "$9,731.41", "endOffset": 1491, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 1482, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "web-based digital currency bitcoin", "endOffset": 1450, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 1416, "type": "PaymentMethod"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1546, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 1563, "text": "made any payments"}, "argument": [{"index": "T17", "text": "None of the securities companies", "endOffset": 1545, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1513, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"date": "2017_02_07", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-idUSKBN15L128"}}
