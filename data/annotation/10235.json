{"content": "Do you trust your tax preparer not to fall for this simple phishing scam? The Internal Revenue Service is warning tax preparers about a new scam designed to steal their usernames and passwords. The hacker\u2019s goal is to break in to the preparer\u2019s computer system and steal client information. The IRS advises the bogus email appears to come from the recipient\u2019s software provider and typically has a subject line that reads something like: \u201cSoftware Support Update\u201d or \u201cImportant Software System Upgrade.\u201d The message tells the preparer they need to revalidate their login credentials and it provides a link to a \u201cfictitious website that mirrors the software provider\u2019s actual login page,\u201d according to an IRS bulletin issued last month. \u201cInstead of upgrading software, the tax professionals are providing their information to cybercriminals who use the stolen credentials to access the preparers' accounts and to steal client information.\" This phishing attack was cleverly designed to launch at the time of year when many software providers release upgrades to professional preparers. It\u2019s also a busy time for preparers who are working to meet the Oct. 15 deadline for clients who filed for extensions. \u201cThis sophisticated scam yet again displays cybercriminals\u2019 tax savvy and underscores the need for tax professionals to take strong security measures to protect their clients and protect their business,\u201d the IRS alert said. Mike Wyatt, a threat researcher with RiskIQ, a digital threat management firm, told NBC News he\u2019s not surprised to see this current attack. Getting people to click on malicious links requires social engineering \u2014 and launching a phishing campaign related to calendar events can be a successful tactic. \u201cCybercriminals very often leverage holidays, events and other important dates in their threat campaigns, so it makes perfect sense that a group is capitalizing on the extended tax deadlines coming up,\u201d he said.  The IRS said it had received reports of \u201cmultiple takeover incidents\u201d in the past year in which the criminals accessed client tax returns, completed those returns, e-filed them and secretly directed refunds to their own accounts. The phishing emails that made these takeovers possible \u201ccan look convincing, appearing to originate from IRS e-Services\u201d the IRS warned. They have subject lines designed to get a quick response, such as: \u201cAccount Closure Now,\u201d \u201cAvoid Account Shutdown,\u201d or \u201cUnlock Your Account Now.\u201d IRS screen captures show that the fake login pages created by the crooks look just like those on the real IRS site. \u201cWe urge tax professionals to be on the lookout for the warning signs of these schemes and many others that can contribute to data loss and identity theft,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement. \u201cA few simple steps can protect tax professionals as well as their clients.\u201d", "sourcefile": "10235.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2238, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 2248, "text": "convincing"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "text": "The phishing emails", "endOffset": 2192, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 2173, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2250, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 2259, "text": "appearing"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "IRS e-Services", "endOffset": 2292, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 2278, "type": "System"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E9", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2507, "index": "T18", "endOffset": 2514, "text": "created"}, "argument": [{"index": "T19", "text": "the crooks", "endOffset": 2528, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2518, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "the fake login pages", "endOffset": 2506, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 2486, "type": "Website"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E8", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2529, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 2543, "text": "look just like"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "the real IRS site", "endOffset": 2570, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 2553, "type": "Website"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 157, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 162, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "their usernames", "endOffset": 178, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 163, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "passwords", "endOffset": 192, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 183, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "tax preparers", "endOffset": 127, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 114, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 59, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 72, "text": "phishing scam"}, "index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Phishing", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 4, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 265, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 270, "text": "steal"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "client information", "endOffset": 289, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 271, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "break in to the preparer\u2019s computer system", "endOffset": 260, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9081684648990631}, "startOffset": 218, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T22", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q21263946"}, "endOffset": 204, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "text": "hacker", "startOffset": 198, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 5, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 323, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 343, "text": "appears to come from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "the recipient\u2019s software provider", "endOffset": 377, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 344, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "the bogus email", "endOffset": 322, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 307, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 6, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 939, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 959, "text": "This phishing attack"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Phishing", "realis": "Generic"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "New Online Scam Targets Tax Preparers \u2014 Is Yours Smart Enough to Avoid It?", "date": "2017_08_15", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/new-online-scam-targets-tax-preparers-yours-smart-enough-avoid-n792806"}}
