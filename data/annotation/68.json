{"content": "A new ransomware campaign is infecting businesses by targeting a department that typically has to open email from strangers: Human resources. Dubbed GoldenEye, a variant of Petya, the ransomware imitates a job application and currently targets German speakers, according to a Check Point report released Tuesday. Here's how it works: An email appears in the HR representative's inbox with a brief message from the supposed applicant, and two attachments. \"The first attachment is a PDF containing a cover letter which has no malicious content and its primary purpose is to lull the victim into a false sense of security,\" the Check Point report said. \"The second attachment is an Excel file with malicious macros unbeknown to the receiver.\" It also includes a message in German asking the HR representative to enable the content. The ransomware presents its victim with a decryption code, which they can enter in a Dark Web portal to pay the ransom and unlock their files. Current ransom rates for GoldenEye begin at 1.3 bitcoins, or about $1,000. Ransomware often targets victims via email attachments. HR departments are especially susceptible, Check Point noted, due to the number of messages and attachments from unfamiliar people they receive.", "sourcefile": "68.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 934, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 948, "text": "pay the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T7", "text": "a Dark Web portal", "endOffset": 930, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 913, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "they", "endOffset": 899, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 895, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q926331"}, "endOffset": 844, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "The ransomware", "startOffset": 830, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "its victim", "endOffset": 864, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 854, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 195, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 203, "text": "imitates"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "a job application", "endOffset": 221, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 204, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "German speakers", "endOffset": 259, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 244, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q23670513"}, "endOffset": 158, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "GoldenEye", "startOffset": 149, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q926331"}, "endOffset": 194, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "the ransomware", "startOffset": 180, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "Tuesday", "endOffset": 311, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 304, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "HR managers beware: Ransomware could be your next job applicant - TechRepublic", "date": "2017_01_05", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.techrepublic.com/article/hr-managers-beware-ransomware-could-be-your-next-job-applicant/"}}
