{"content": "Members of the Girl Scouts of Orange County were notified this week that their personal information may have been exposed to an unknown party who gained access to an organization email account last month, according to a letter sent to members. The organization sent the letter Tuesday to about 2,800 members who may have been affected by the data breach. Christina Salcido, vice president of mission operations, said members\u2019 names, birth dates, home addresses, insurance policy numbers and health history information could have been accessed from Sept 30 to Oct 1. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we are notifying everyone whose email was in this email account,\u201d Salcido wrote in the letter. On the day the organization became aware of the breach, IT services changed the password and determined it was secure, Salcido wrote. The Girl Scouts of Orange County reviewed the account, eliminated all personal information it contained and notified the California attorney general\u2019s office of the breach. Because the email account was used for the organization\u2019s travel purposes, it contained information about members dating to 2014. Salcido said the third party used the account to send messages, but she did not specify what type of messages were sent. Elizabeth Fairchild, spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Orange County, said staff members noticed Oct 1 that the email account had been used the day before \u201cto send out non-Girl Scout related emails.\u201d On Oct 1, staff members sent an email to members telling them what happened, stating they had secured the account and advising them to not open any unusual emails from that account. \u201cThe vast majority of information stored in the account was nonsensitive,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cFewer than 300 had sensitive information stored in the account.\u201d The Girl Scouts of Orange County provided contact information for the credit bureaus Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and suggested that members place fraud alerts on their accounts. If members have questions or concerns about the breach, they can call (800) 974-9444 or email customercare@girlscoutsoc.org.", "sourcefile": "10009.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 104, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 121, "text": "have been exposed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "an unknown party", "endOffset": 141, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 125, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "their personal information", "endOffset": 99, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 73, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "Members", "endOffset": 7, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA", "wikidataid": "Q2576280"}, "endOffset": 43, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "the Girl Scouts of Orange County", "startOffset": 11, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "this week", "endOffset": 67, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 58, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 338, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 353, "text": "the data breach"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "members", "endOffset": 307, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 300, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "2,800", "endOffset": 299, "role": {"type": "Number-of-Victim"}, "startOffset": 294, "type": "Number"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "Tuesday", "endOffset": 284, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 277, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 524, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 542, "text": "have been accessed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "from Sept 30 to Oct 1", "endOffset": 564, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 543, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "names", "endOffset": 431, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 426, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "birth dates", "endOffset": 444, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 433, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "home addresses", "endOffset": 460, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 446, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "insurance policy numbers", "endOffset": 486, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 462, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "health history information", "endOffset": 517, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 491, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "members", "endOffset": 424, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 417, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 146, "index": "T18", "endOffset": 159, "text": "gained access"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "last month", "endOffset": 203, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 193, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "email account", "endOffset": 192, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 179, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T21", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q15911314"}, "endOffset": 178, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "organization", "startOffset": 166, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Data breach may have exposed personal information for thousands of Girl Scouts", "date": "2018_10_25", "type": "text", "link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-girl-scouts-data-breach-20181025-story.html"}}
