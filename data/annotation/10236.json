{"content": "One needs to be always aware of Tax Scams, including tax refund scams, which are carried out by scamsters who pretend to be from the IRS of USA, HMRC of UK, CRA of Canada, Income Tax Department of India and such. Scamsters contact you via fake emails, phone calls, recorded message, SMS, etc, and either scare you with the possibility of some legal action or entice you with a tax refund! Every tax season, Tax Scams start doing the rounds. Emails, Phone calls, or recorded messages by cybercriminals impersonating authentic tax agents have become an order of the day and continue to remain a major threat to taxpayers. The scam artists use sinister designs that threaten police arrest, deportation, and even license revocation. With the increases in its popularity, fraudsters are also busy finding more ways to increase efficiency. Earlier, the major targets were elderly people and immigrant population. Slowly, the focus has shifted to methods that rely on auto-dialers, robocalling, and voice mail messages to hit as many taxpayers as possible. The story begins with an automated call. It plays a recorded message warning you that it\u2019s \u201cthe final notice\u201d from the tax agency such as the Internal Revenue Service, Indian Income Tax Department, HM Revenue and Customs, or the Tax department of your country. Or it could begin with an email. In any case, the recorded voice or email purports to be from tax inspector and goes on to specify about the course of action, the agency is likely to follow against you like, planning a lawsuit against you, and if you don\u2019t return this call, you could land up in jail, soon. Attacks, such as these use fear as bait or the lure of a tax refund on the other hand. They rely on social engineering tactics. One such message tells recipients that there\u2019s a pending law enforcement action against them as they have evaded tax. It is mainly used to target U.S. taxpayers. The scam pretends to contain information about a subpoena. It could contain a web link which it wants you to click. The link could take you to a fraudulent website. Or the email could include an attachment. The file is a \u201cdocument file\u201d that Microsoft Word opens in Protected View. It contains an instruction to Enable Editing. If the Enable Editing button is clicked, malicious Macros in the \u2018document\u2019 downloads a malware. So one needs to always exercise utmost caution in either of the cases.", "sourcefile": "10236.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 223, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 230, "text": "contact"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "fake emails", "endOffset": 250, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 239, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "you", "endOffset": 234, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 231, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Scamsters", "endOffset": 222, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 213, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 359, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 365, "text": "entice"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "you", "endOffset": 369, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 366, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 110, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 123, "text": "pretend to be"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "scamsters", "endOffset": 105, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 96, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T2", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Internal_Revenue_Service", "wikidataid": "Q973587"}, "endOffset": 143, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "the IRS of USA", "startOffset": 129, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Revenue_and_Customs", "wikidataid": "Q166559"}, "endOffset": 155, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "HMRC of UK", "startOffset": 145, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q16"}, "endOffset": 170, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "CRA of Canada", "startOffset": 157, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Income_Tax_Department", "wikidataid": "Q17055919"}, "endOffset": 202, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "text": "Income Tax Department of India", "startOffset": 172, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1666, "index": "T20", "endOffset": 1670, "text": "lure"}, "argument": [{"index": "T21", "text": "a tax refund", "endOffset": 1686, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 1674, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1651, "index": "T24", "endOffset": 1658, "text": "as bait"}, "index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Phishing", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 4, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 501, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 514, "text": "impersonating"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "authentic tax agents", "endOffset": 535, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 515, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "cybercriminals", "endOffset": 500, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 486, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "threaten police arrest, deportation, and even license revocation", "endOffset": 727, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9029620885848999}, "startOffset": 663, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T23", "text": "remain a major threat to taxpayers", "endOffset": 618, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9243048429489136}, "startOffset": 584, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 5, "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1385, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 1399, "text": "purports to be"}, "argument": [{"index": "T17", "text": "tax inspector", "endOffset": 1418, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 1405, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T19", "text": "email", "endOffset": 1384, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1379, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "the recorded voice", "endOffset": 1375, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1357, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Beware of Online Tax Scams & Frauds and stay safe!", "date": "2017_04_03", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.thewindowsclub.com/beware-tax-scams-stay-safe"}}
