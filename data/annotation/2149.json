{"content": "When you\u2019re as ginormous a target as the global telecommunications industry, and you\u2019re sitting on a flaw as big as the one affecting its SS7 protocol, best not rely on \u201csecurity through obscurity\u201d. You and your customers could get badly bitten \u2013 and so they have. The\u00a0Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) telephony signaling protocol used to establish interoperability across some 800+ service providers worldwide, is deeply vulnerable to interception by hackers, criminals, and corrupt insiders. We\u2019ve known this for years. Now, in Germany, someone\u2019s used that vulnerability to raid consumers\u2019 online bank accounts. SS7 was designed back in the 1970s, when access to phone networks was viewed as rare and controllable: back then, for example, AT&T still had an essentially complete monopoly over all US phone service. But now, a world of internet, VoIP, and wireless providers can link into SS7 to do all manner of fascinating things, and mess-with-SS7 skills and tools aren\u2019t nearly so scarce. The telecom industry, however, has been appallingly slow to react. Maybe they will now. As first reported by the German daily newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, this two-part attack zeroed in on SS7 call-forwarding features that allow networks to validate your SIM card when you travel internationally. First, according to Bank Info Security, hackers sent conventional fake phishing emails to victims, suckering them into visiting fake bank websites, where they were told to enter account numbers, passwords and the mobile phone numbers they had previously given their banks. Meanwhile, per The Register, the attackers \u201cpurchased access to a rogue telecommunications provider and set up a redirect for the victim\u2019s mobile phone number to a handset controlled by the attackers\u201d. Now, they could wait until late at night, log into the victims\u2019 online accounts, and start money transfers. As part of their SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) systems, the banks would dutifully send one-time mobile transaction authentication number (mTAN) numbers to their customers. These would be hijacked by the criminals, who now had the second authentication factor they needed to complete the thefts. The short-term solution is for telecommunications service providers to turn off SS7\u2019s call forwarding features except for trusted providers. O2-Telefonica told S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that it blocked the specific foreign carriers who were the source of these attacks in January \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t prevent similar attacks arising from other sources against other carriers.", "sourcefile": "2149.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 124, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 133, "text": "affecting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "flaw", "endOffset": 105, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 101, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "SS7", "endOffset": 141, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 138, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T4", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q1266169"}, "endOffset": 75, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "text": "the global telecommunications industry", "startOffset": 37, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 419, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 429, "text": "vulnerable"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "service providers", "endOffset": 397, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "startOffset": 380, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "The\u00a0Signalling System No. 7", "endOffset": 292, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 265, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "SS7", "endOffset": 297, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 294, "type": "System"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "interception by hackers, criminals, and corrupt insiders", "endOffset": 489, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Excavation", "type": "Capabilities", "confidence": 0.9086326956748962}, "startOffset": 433, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1337, "index": "T10", "endOffset": 1341, "text": "sent"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 1336, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1329, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "fake phishing emails", "endOffset": 1375, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1355, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "victims", "endOffset": 1386, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1379, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "enter account numbers, passwords and the mobile phone numbers", "endOffset": 1522, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Gathering data", "confidence": 0.8803837895393372}, "startOffset": 1461, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "visiting fake bank websites", "endOffset": 1435, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8503461480140686}, "startOffset": 1408, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Bank accounts raided after crooks exploit huge flaw in mobile networks \u2013 Naked Security", "date": "2017_05_08", "type": "text", "link": "https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/05/05/bank-accounts-raided-after-crooks-exploit-huge-flaw-in-mobile-networks/?utm_source=Naked+Security+-+Sophos+List&utm_campaign=11069381cb-naked%252Bsecurity&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_31623bb782-11069381cb-455160889"}}
