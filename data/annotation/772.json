{"content": "Last week I ran across a very successful phishing campaign, what\u2019s odd in most ways it was nothing special. The attacker was using this more like a worm, where stolen credentials would be used within the hour to start sending out a mass amount of more phishes. I've decided to call this \"Dynamite Phishing\" because there is nothing quiet about this at all. It seems about 40% of the credentials were used for more mailings, and the other account's credentials had not been used. The initial phishes came in from a K12 domain from several affected individuals. The email subject was \u00a0\u201cYou have an Incoming Document Share With You Via Google Docs\u201d.

It appears the EM_Client is a pretty popular email client, but it maybe something you can block on depending on your environment. user-agent: eM_Client/7.0.27943.0 While most people have good protections from Emails coming from external entities into their email environment, many don\u2019t push the same protections intra-domain.
