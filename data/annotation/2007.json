{"content": "In examples uncovered by Check Point, the emails were made to look like they were sent from a tax agency, and ostensibly warn the recipients about inconsistencies in their tax returns. The attached file (Dokument.zip) they are instructed to open is made to look like a document file, but is actually an application. If the victim downloads and opens it, it will perform a myriad of silent changes on the target machine, all geared towards setting up a malicious proxy server, which will allow the attacker to gain complete access to all victim communication. \u201c[The malware] uses sophisticated means to monitor\u2014and potentially alter\u2014all HTTP and HTTPS traffic to and from the infected Mac. This means that the malware is capable, for example, of capturing account credentials for any website users log into, which offers many opportunities for theft of cash and data,\u201d Malwarebytes researchers explained. \u201cFurther, OSX.Dok could modify the data being sent and received for the purpose of redirecting users to malicious websites in place of legitimate ones.\u201d In another instance, unearthed by Malwarebytes, another variant of the same dropper doesn\u2019t do the fake \u201cOS X Updates Available\u201d routine, but installs an open source backdoor named Bella, generally available from GitHub. The software is a Python script capable of extracting a wide variety of sensitive data from macOS machines (passwords, keychain, screenshots, location data, iMessage and SMS chat transcripts, etc.). This version of the script has been configured to connect to a C&C server in Moscow. \u201cBusiness users should be aware that this malware could exfiltrate a large amount of company data, including passwords, code signing certificates, hardware locations and much more. If you\u2019ve been infected, contact your IT department,\u201d the researchers advised, and noted that it is unknown whether there is any connection between Noah, the author of Bella, and the creators of the OSX.Dok malware.  \u201cBella may simply have been used by unrelated hackers since it is freely available as open-source software,\u201d they pointed out. Well, the valid developer certificate that has been used to sign the malware has been revoked by Apple, so potential new victims won\u2019t be able to open the app and get infected.  Of course, future versions of the malware could be signed with another, likely stolen, developer certificate. In the meantime, though, users who have been successfully hit with OSX.Dok are advised to either erase the hard drive and restore the system from a backup made prior to infection, or get help in cleaning the machine from an expert. \u201cRemoval of the malware can be accomplished by simply removing the two [malicious] LaunchAgents files, but there are many leftovers and modifications to the system that cannot be as easily reversed. Changes to the sudoers file should be reversed and a knowledgeable user can easily do so using a good text editor (like BBEdit), but making the wrong changes to that file can cause serious problems,\u201d they noted. The bad certificate should also be removed, and so should a LaunchAgents file named homebrew.mxcl.tor.plist. But, according to them, \u201cthe numerous legitimate command-line tools installed, consisting of tens of thousands of files, cannot be easily removed.\u201d", "sourcefile": "2007.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 54, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 71, "text": "made to look like"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "the emails", "endOffset": 48, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 38, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 77, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 91, "text": "were sent from"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "they", "endOffset": 76, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 72, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "a tax agency", "endOffset": 104, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 92, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1321, "index": "T9", "endOffset": 1331, "text": "extracting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "a Python script", "endOffset": 1309, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1294, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "sensitive data", "endOffset": 1364, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1350, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "macOS machines", "endOffset": 1384, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1370, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "passwords", "endOffset": 1395, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1386, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T18", "text": "SMS chat transcripts", "endOffset": 1468, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1448, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "iMessage", "endOffset": 1443, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1435, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "location data", "endOffset": 1433, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1420, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "screenshots", "endOffset": 1418, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1407, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "keychain", "endOffset": 1405, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1397, "type": "Data"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1612, "index": "T20", "endOffset": 1628, "text": "could exfiltrate"}, "argument": [{"index": "T19", "text": "this malware", "endOffset": 1611, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1599, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T25", "text": "Business users", "endOffset": 1577, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1563, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T24", "text": "hardware locations", "endOffset": 1727, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1709, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T23", "text": "code signing certificates", "endOffset": 1707, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1682, "type": "Data"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "passwords", "endOffset": 1680, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1671, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "company data", "endOffset": 1659, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 1647, "type": "Data"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 249, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 266, "text": "made to look like"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "The attached file (Dokument.zip)", "endOffset": 217, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 185, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "a document file", "endOffset": 282, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 267, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Dok Mac malware intercepts victims' web traffic, installs backdoor - Help Net Security", "date": "2017_05_02", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/05/02/dok-mac-malware/"}}
