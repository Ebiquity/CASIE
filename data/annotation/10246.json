{"content": "Six weeks after ransomware forced Colorado Department of Transportation\u2019s back-end operations offline, the agency is back to 80 percent functionality \u2014 at an estimated cost of up to $1.5 million, according to the state. Colorado officials said they never caved to the attacker\u2019s demands to pay bitcoin in order to recover encrypted computer files. But clearing each computer took time and additional resources \u2014 including the Colorado National Guard \u2014 to investigate, contain and recover. \u201cWe were able to recover from the SamSam attack relatively quickly due to our robust backup plan and our segmentation strategies,\u201d Brandi Simmons, a spokesperson for Colorado\u2019s Office of Information Technology, said in an email. \u201cWe are still capturing costs associated with the incident, but our estimate is between $1M and $1.5M.\u201d What started with a core team of 25 IT employees, Simmons said, ballooned to 150  \u201cduring the peak of the incident\u201d \u2014 March 2-9. She added that others included CDOT, the FBI, state emergency operations and private companies. The million-dollar estimate includes only overtime pay and other unexpected costs. The state\u2019s new backup system prevented data loss, but personal data on employees\u2019 computers may not be recovered. The cyberattack started around Feb 21 when a variant of the SamSam ransomware hijacked CDOT computer files. CDOT shut down more than 2,000 computers. Its employees had to use personal devices to check email. The state did not share the value of bitcoin that attackers demanded. Elsewhere, SamSam attacked the city of Atlanta, debilitating computer systems that residents used to pay traffic tickets, report potholes and access Wi-Fi at the airport. The city hasn\u2019t issued a public update since March 30, and a city spokesman said Thursday there is nothing new to share. Attackers demanded $51,000 worth of bitcoin. Asked whether Atlanta has paid the ransom, spokeswoman Anne Torres said: \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot comment further on the ransom.\u201d The rise of ransomware attacks has caused some to wonder whether it\u2019s worth paying to avoid business outages \u2014 Hancock Health in Indiana paid $55,000 to get its files back. Dan Likarish, a computer professor at Denver\u2019s Regis University, said there\u2019s still a good reason not to do it. \u201cIf you pay the ransom, you\u2019re supporting the criminal,\u201d said Likarish, adding there\u2019s also no guarantee the attacker will return computer files intact. \u201cThe weasel answer? It\u2019s a risk mitigation. That\u2019s the way we label ourselves. We talk to upper management, present the business case that we\u2019ve identified the problem, let\u2019s just pay. That\u2019s what a lot of hospitals have done. It\u2019s not unusual to pay for the key and go about your business. It depends on how sophisticated your security staff is. If you don\u2019t have it, what do you do? You\u2019ve got to keep things running.\u201d Likarish said he was able to help with efforts to contain the CDOT attack and was in awe at how the state\u2019s IT office swooped in and took command. While IT staff had already updated its own computer operations, not every state agency is on the same system, including CDOT. \u201cPeople are listening to them now,\u201d Likarish said.", "sourcefile": "10246.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 279, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 301, "text": "demands to pay bitcoin"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "they", "endOffset": 248, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 244, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "Colorado officials", "endOffset": 238, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 220, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T22", "text": "the attacker", "endOffset": 276, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 264, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1513, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 1521, "text": "demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T5", "text": "attackers", "endOffset": 1512, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1503, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q132783"}, "endOffset": 1462, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "The state", "startOffset": 1453, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1825, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 1833, "text": "demanded"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "$51,000", "endOffset": 1841, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 1834, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "worth of bitcoin", "endOffset": 1858, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 1842, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Attackers", "endOffset": 1824, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1815, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1882, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 1901, "text": "has paid the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T11", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q23556"}, "endOffset": 1881, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "text": "Atlanta", "startOffset": 1874, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 1978, "index": "T13", "endOffset": 1988, "text": "the ransom"}, "index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E8", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2284, "index": "T19", "endOffset": 2298, "text": "pay the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T20", "text": "you", "endOffset": 2283, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2280, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T21", "text": "the criminal", "endOffset": 2330, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 2318, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 2003, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 2021, "text": "ransomware attacks"}, "index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Generic"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 2128, "index": "T15", "endOffset": 2132, "text": "paid"}, "argument": [{"index": "T18", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indiana", "wikidataid": "Q1415"}, "endOffset": 2127, "role": {"type": "Place"}, "text": "Indiana", "startOffset": 2120, "type": "GPE"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "Hancock Health", "endOffset": 2116, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 2102, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "$55,000", "endOffset": 2140, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 2133, "type": "Money"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Cyber attack on CDOT computers estimated to cost up to $1.5 million so far", "date": "2018_04_06", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/05/samsam-ransomware-cdot-cost/"}}
