{"content": "The hackers could then lock these computers \u00a0up and demand a ransom or else cause a blackout or poison the city's water. While that's a scary scenario, it fortunately \u00a0hasn't happened\u2014yet. But a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology warn that could change very soon, and to prove it they have developed and tested in their lab a working proof of concept ransomware that specifically targets three types of PLCs. In their scenario, a group of cybercriminals targets PLCs that are exposed online and infects them with custom malware designed to reprogram the tiny computer with a new password, locking out the legitimate owners. The hackers then alert the owner, asking for a ransom. \"Ransomware\" is a specific type of malicious software that infects computers and locks or encrypts their content, demanding a ransom to return the machines \u00a0to their original state. It's been extremely popular in the last couple of years, and is often successful because it's usually easier for victims to pay the ransom than try to decrypt the files on their own. Initially, ransomware targeted regular internet users indiscriminately, but there have already been cases of attacks against hospitals, hotels and other businesses. (And there will soon be attacks on Internet of Things too)  Thus, the researchers argue, it's inevitable that criminals will soon target critical infrastructure directly. Beyah and his colleagues David Formby and Srikar Durbha searched the internet for the two models of PLCs that they attacked in the lab and found more 1,500 that were exposed online. With their research, Beyah said, the three hope that industrial control systems administrators will start adopting common security practices such as changing the PLCs default passwords, putting them behind a firewall, and scanning the networks for potential intruders. If they don't, they might find their systems locked, and the consequence could spill into the physical world.", "sourcefile": "627.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 685, "index": "T6", "endOffset": 704, "text": "asking for a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "the owner", "endOffset": 683, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 674, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "The hackers", "endOffset": 662, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 651, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 52, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 67, "text": "demand a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "lock these computers \u00a0up", "endOffset": 47, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Physical Theft", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.888640284538269}, "startOffset": 23, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "The hackers", "endOffset": 11, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 0, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T12", "text": "city", "endOffset": 111, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 107, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1012, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1026, "text": "pay the ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "victims", "endOffset": 1008, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1001, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 820, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 838, "text": "demanding a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "external_reference": {"wikidataid": "Q926331"}, "endOffset": 717, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "text": "Ransomware", "startOffset": 707, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "the machines", "endOffset": 861, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 849, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "locks or encrypts their content", "endOffset": 818, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8911884725093842}, "startOffset": 787, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T15", "text": "infects computers", "endOffset": 782, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Malicious Logic Insertion", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.9094651937484741}, "startOffset": 765, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "A New Type of Malware Can Lock Power Plant Computers For Ransom - Motherboard", "date": "2017_02_14", "type": "text", "link": "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a-new-type-of-malware-can-lock-power-plant-computers-for-ransom"}}
