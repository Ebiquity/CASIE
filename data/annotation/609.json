{"content": "Islamic State supporters are warning one another of malware targeting the militant group through the chat app Telegram. One member on a popular ISIS forum alerted users to plus_gram.apk, a trojanized RAT (a remote access tool disguised as harmless software)\u00a0that allows an attacker to spy on and take full control of the target\u2019s Android device. The ISIS supporter used malware analysis at NVISIO, a popular free platform to test Android software for malicious code. The warning was first spotted\u00a0and described\u00a0by @switch_d, a veteran ISIS watcher. This attack arrives as a phishing link disguised as an invitation to a video chat, according to the warning, a tactic ISIS supporters have fallen victim to in the past. The responses to the warning include a thanks and common sense guidance to \u201conly accept files from brothers you know\u201d. This malware runs in multiple stages,\u00a0Khalil Sehnaoui, a Middle East-based cybersecurity specialist and founder of\u00a0Krypton Security, told\u00a0CyberScoop. \u201cThe exploit code is usually small and after successful exploitation it runs a dropper code which will in turn download new applications/malware in order to get more control of the system by escalating privileges\u201d.", "sourcefile": "609.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 588, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 600, "text": "disguised as"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "a phishing link", "endOffset": 587, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 572, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "an invitation", "endOffset": 614, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 601, "type": "File"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 549, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 560, "text": "This attack"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Phishing", "realis": "Actual"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 226, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 238, "text": "disguised as"}, "argument": [{"index": "T3", "text": "harmless software", "endOffset": 256, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 239, "type": "Software"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "a remote access tool", "endOffset": 225, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 205, "type": "Malware"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "trojanized RAT", "endOffset": 203, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 189, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Islamic State supporters hit by Android malware on Telegram - CyberScoop", "date": "2017_02_13", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.cyberscoop.com/isis-malware-telegram-android/"}}
