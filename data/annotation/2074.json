{"content": "The\u00a0OurMine hackers\u00a0are back in the news again. This time the group hacked and defaced the official domain of\u00a0Unity 3D Forums leaving a deface page along with a note over the weekend.\u00a0 The hack which took place on 30th April allowed the Saudi Arabia-based\u00a0OurMine hacking group to compromise the forum\u2019s security and leave a note stating \u201cHacked by OurMine, Your Security is low.\u201d Unity 3D administrators have acknowledged the hack but stated that no password was\u00a0stolen in the attack and that the 2FA Authentication will be introduced to the forums for better security. Furthermore, the administrators\u00a0are also planning to bring Device Identification and Password Policy on the forums. According to the official statement from\u00a0Unity 3D: Thanks to everyone that have reached out about our forums being compromised \u2013 we are on it! \u2014 Unity (@unity3d) April 30, 2017 One of the team members from Unity stated on Reddit that:\u00a0 After the hack, the Unity 3D forums was down for maintenance though at the time of publishing this article the forums were online and reachable. However, if you have an account on Unity 3D forums it is advised that you change your password. Just in case if you are not familiar with the OurMine then this is the same group who conducted the\u00a0biggest hack in YouTube\u2019s history last month by taking over hundreds of popular YouTube accounts and defacing their titles with #OurMine signature. The same group\u00a0was in the news for hacking\u00a0Google\u2019s CEO\u00a0Sundar Pichai,\u00a0Facebook\u2019s CEO\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg,\u00a0Co-founder of Twitter\u00a0Jack Dorsey\u00a0and several other top media celebrities and news outlets. It is unclear how OurMine hacks its victims but\u00a0researchers believe that the group uses passwords stolen from previous data breaches including LinkedIn and MySpace. The group is also working on establishing\u00a0itself as an IT security firm to help companies against cyber attacks, however, it is unclear whether\u00a0such tactics will give them clients or scare them away.
