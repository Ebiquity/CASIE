{"content": "The engineering firm refused to meet the hackers\u2019 demands and the Daily Echo understands it lost access to vital data including personal information about its staff, who number around 100. Businesses have been warned that such \u2018ransomware\u2019 attacks are on the rise and that companies need to train all staff to be vigilant. Police said an East Dorset company \u2013 which the Echo is not naming \u2013 had reported on June 1 that it was the victim of computer fraud.   \u201cIt was reported that their computer was hacked and a demand was made for \u00a3120,000,\u201d a Dorset Police spokeswoman said. \u201cThe victim was referred to Action Fraud to report.\u201d Ian Girling, chief executive of Dorset Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: \u201cCyber crime is on the increase and all companies are vulnerable to attack. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is that staff are trained because it\u2019s quite often staff opening emails and dealing with stuff. Responsibility doesn\u2019t just lie with IT departments. All staff need to be aware of the potential threat to the business. \u201cThere are lots of good companies in Dorset to help businesses with this.\u201d The incident echoes the WannaCry ransomware attack which infected an estimated 200,000 computers globally last year, including up to 70,000 in the NHS. Matt Horan, security director of C3IA Solutions in Poole \u2013 one of the first companies to be certified by the government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre \u2013 said: \u201cYou should never pay a ransom because there is no guarantee you will get your data back. During an attack the data doesn\u2019t go anywhere, it is just encrypted and you need a decryption key or algorithm to unlock it and get it back. \u201cIf you pay a criminal to return your data there is a good chance that he or she will take the money and not decrypt the data \u2013 or even ask for more money.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to back up all data and to ensure it\u2019s backed up without the virus or ransomware in it. Therefore all backups should be virus checked prior to storage off-site.\u201cYou do not want to clean your system of the malware only to re-introduce the same problem from your back-up. It\u2019s also important to regularly check the back-up to ensure data can be recovered from it.\u201d General Sir Chris Deverell, commander of the UK\u2019s Joint Forces Command, warned yesterday of cyber threats from abroad, which could target infrastructure such as power stations and air traffic control. \u201cWe must make sure our cyber security is constantly improving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important thing and every sector of society is very focused on it.\u201d  ", "sourcefile": "10243.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Other", "nugget": {"startOffset": 51, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 58, "text": "demands"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "The engineering firm", "endOffset": 21, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T17", "text": "hackers", "endOffset": 49, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 42, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 511, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 528, "text": "a demand was made"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "\u00a3120,000", "endOffset": 541, "role": {"type": "Price"}, "startOffset": 533, "type": "Money"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "was hacked", "endOffset": 506, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Resource Leak Exposure", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8544215559959412}, "startOffset": 496, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T16", "text": "their computer", "endOffset": 495, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 481, "type": "Device"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 228, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 248, "text": "\u2018ransomware\u2019 attacks"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "General"}]}, {"index": 2, "events": [{"index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1655, "index": "T12", "endOffset": 1658, "text": "pay"}, "argument": [{"index": "T13", "text": "you", "endOffset": 1654, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1651, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T14", "text": "a criminal", "endOffset": 1669, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 1659, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 3, "events": [{"nugget": {"startOffset": 1783, "index": "T15", "endOffset": 1801, "text": "ask for more money"}, "index": "E7", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "General"}]}, {"index": 4, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1123, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 1153, "text": "the WannaCry ransomware attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T8", "text": "infected an estimated 200,000 computers", "endOffset": 1199, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Flooding", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8919951915740967}, "startOffset": 1160, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "last year", "endOffset": 1218, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1209, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 5, "events": [{"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "General", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1421, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 1446, "text": "should never pay a ransom"}, "argument": [{"index": "T10", "text": "You", "endOffset": 1420, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 1417, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Ransomware hackers demand \u00a3120,000", "date": "2018_06_14", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/16289805.ransomware-hackers-demand-120000/"}}
