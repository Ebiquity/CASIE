{"content": "A bug in the way that Mobile Safari handles pop-up dialogs has been abused to scare iOS users into paying a \u201cfine\u201d in the form of an iTunes pre-paid card. \u201cThis attack was initially reported to Lookout\u2019s Support desk by one of our users running iOS 10.2. \u201cThe user provided a screenshot showing a ransomware message from pay-police[. ]com, with an overlaid \u2018Cannot Open Page\u2019 dialog from Safari. Each time he tapped \u2018OK\u2019 he would be prompted to tap \u2018OK\u2019 again, effectively putting the browser into an infinite loop of dialog prompts that prevented him from using the browser\u201d. The scammers have purchased a large number of different domains, and equipped them with obfuscated JavaScript code that would trigger the bug in Mobile Safari. The intended targets were mostly from English-speaking countries: the US, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The attack was contained within Safari\u2019s sandbox, so the victims\u2019 devices were not actually compromised.The attackers banked on users\u2019 fear and shame to pull the scam off. Lookout notified Apple of the attack, and the iThings manufacturer fixed the abused flaw in iOS 10.3, which was released on Monday. \u201cThe pop-up window error dialog on newer versions of iOS is actually the result of Mobile Safari not being able to find a local URL lookup, so it fails, but keeps presenting the dialog message due to the infinite loop in the code,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cThe attack, based on its code, seems to have been developed for older versions of iOS, such as iOS 8. However, the abuse of pop-ups in Mobile Safari was still possible until iOS 10.3\u201d. With the new iOS version, these pop-ups won\u2019t be locking the entire browser, but just that one tab, which can be simply closed and the user can continue using the browser like nothing happened. Users are advised to update their iOS-running iThings to version 10.3 to close up this particular attack vector", "sourcefile": "1330.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1135, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 1147, "text": "was released"}, "argument": [{"index": "T2", "text": "Monday", "endOffset": 1157, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 1151, "type": "Time"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1094, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 1099, "text": "fixed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "the iThings manufacturer", "endOffset": 1093, "role": {"type": "Releaser"}, "startOffset": 1069, "type": "Organization"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "the abused flaw", "endOffset": 1115, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 1100, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T11", "text": "10.3", "endOffset": 1127, "role": {"type": "Patch-Number"}, "startOffset": 1123, "type": "Version"}, {"index": "T3", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/IOS_10"}, "endOffset": 1122, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "iOS", "startOffset": 1119, "type": "System"}], "subtype": "PatchVulnerability"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 99, "index": "T7", "endOffset": 114, "text": "paying a \u201cfine\u201d"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "iOS users", "endOffset": 93, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 84, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "an iTunes pre-paid card", "endOffset": 153, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 130, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "Mobile Safari handles pop-up dialogs has been abused", "endOffset": 74, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "File Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8934558629989624}, "startOffset": 22, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Scareware scammers target iOS users - Help Net Security", "date": "2017_03_28", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/03/28/ios-scareware/"}}
