{"content": "A popular horse racing website (Racingpulse.in) that operates out of Bangalore, India was reportedly hacked on Tuesday. The hackers posted a statement on the home page informing that the entire data on the website has been encrypted. As is the norm, they also informed about what they expected as ransom. The ransom note suggested that they were expecting ransom amount in Bitcoins while the amount to be paid was not disclosed clearly. The message also included an email address for further communication, which was registered at india.com. The hackers offered Racingpulse.in an unimaginable favor by providing decryption key of a maximum of three files which should not be more than 10mb in size for free. This was probably done to prove that they did hack all the files on the site. The note read: \u201cAll your files have been encrypted: All your files have been encrypted due to a security problem with your PC. If you want to restore them, write us to the e-mail mkgoro@india.com, You have to pay for decryption in Bitcoins. After payment, we will send you the decryption tool that will decrypt all your files. \u201cFree decryption as a guarantee: Before paying you can send to us up to 3 files for free decryption. The message contained a link to the beginners\u2019 guide to Bitcoins too. \u201cHow to obtain Bitcoins: The easiest way to buy bitcoins is LocalBitcoins site. You have to register, click \u2018Buy bitcoins\u2019, and select the seller by payment method and price. The ransomware used in this attack is a new version of Dharma Ransomware Trojan. In the ransom note, hackers have provided the email address mkgoro@india.com, which is a contact email for the victims to facilitate communication with them. According to security researchers, this new version of Dharma works just like the older version using unsolicited emails. These emails contain social network logos, bank information, payment portals and an option to download and open a file. The previous two attacks were countered by using backup files, said Kumar. \u201cWe have now decided to move to another server in the hope of better security, it may take a day for the site to be up and running,\u201d revealed Kumar.", "sourcefile": "301.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 341, "index": "T5", "endOffset": 355, "text": "were expecting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T6", "text": "The ransom note", "endOffset": 320, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 305, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "Bitcoins", "endOffset": 381, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 373, "type": "PaymentMethod"}, {"index": "T1", "text": "they", "endOffset": 340, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 336, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 356, "index": "T16", "endOffset": 369, "text": "ransom amount"}, "index": "E6", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}, {"index": "E3", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 132, "index": "T4", "endOffset": 138, "text": "posted"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "The hackers", "endOffset": 131, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 120, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T10", "text": "a statement", "endOffset": 150, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 139, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T8", "text": "the home page", "endOffset": 167, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 154, "type": "Website"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "the website has been encrypted", "endOffset": 232, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Shared Data Manipulation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8988480865955353}, "startOffset": 202, "type": "Capabilities"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}, {"nugget": {"startOffset": 285, "index": "T3", "endOffset": 303, "text": "expected as ransom"}, "index": "E2", "type": "Attack", "subtype": "Ransom", "realis": "Actual"}, {"index": "E5", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 1482, "index": "T14", "endOffset": 1493, "text": "this attack"}, "argument": [{"index": "T15", "text": "Dharma Ransomware Trojan", "endOffset": 1538, "role": {"type": "Tool"}, "startOffset": 1514, "type": "Malware"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Generic", "nugget": {"startOffset": 987, "index": "T11", "endOffset": 998, "text": "have to pay"}, "argument": [{"index": "T12", "text": "You", "endOffset": 986, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 983, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "in Bitcoins", "endOffset": 1025, "role": {"type": "Payment-Method"}, "startOffset": 1014, "type": "PaymentMethod"}], "subtype": "Ransom"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "India\u2019s Famous Horse Racing Site Hacked with Dharma Ransomware", "date": "2017_01_23", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.hackread.com/india-horse-racing-site-hacked-with-dharma-ransomware/"}}
