{"content": "A pediatrics practice, ABCD Pediatrics, serving the San Antonio, Texas metropolitan area reported that it was hit with a ransomware attack, but existing antivirus software helped to slow down the attack, and the practice's IT vendor successfully removed the virus and all corrupt data from its servers. However, because hackers may have accessed portions of the practice\u2019s network, the pediatrics group is offering identity and credit protection services from Equifax Personal Solutions to all of its patients. The pediatrics group, which has four locations, posted a \u201cHIPAA Notification\u201d on its website, regarding an incident that may have affected patients\u2019 protected health information (PHI). The practice stated that the notice was made in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Prior to the attack, ABCD Pediatrics had a variety of security measures in place, including network filtering and security monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection, according to the organization\u2019s statement. On February 6, 2017, an employee of ABCD Pediatrics discovered that a virus gained access and began encrypting ABCD\u2019s servers. The encryption was slowed significantly by existing antivirus software. Upon discovery, ABCD immediately contacted its IT vendor, and ABCD\u2019s servers and computers were promptly moved offline and analyzed. The virus was identified as \u201cDharma Ransomware,\u201d which is a variant of an older ransomware virus called \u201cCriSiS,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s IT vendor. \u201cABCD\u2019s IT company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate (\u201cremove\u201d) data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out. Also, during the analysis of ABCD\u2019s servers and computers, suspicious user accounts were discovered suggesting that hackers may have accessed portions of ABCD\u2019s network,\u201d the organization stated. The IT vendor successfully removed the virus and all corrupt data from its servers, and the practice said that secure backup data stored separately from its servers and computers was not compromised by the incident, and it was used to restore all affected data. According to the organization, no confidential information was lost or destroyed, including PHI, and the practice group never received a ransom demand or other communications from unknown persons. In addition to notifying its patients, ABCD notified the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. According to the HHS\u2019 Office of Civil Rights\u2019 data breach portal, the incident affected 55,447 patients. While the IT vendor found no evidence that confidential information was actually acquired or removed from its servers and computers, it could not rule out the possibility that confidential information may have been viewed and possibly was acquired, according the ABCD Pediatrics\u2019 statement. Affected information may have included patients\u2019 names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers, insurance billing information, medical records, and laboratory reports. Following this incident, ABCD\u2019s IT vendor located the source of the intrusion and implemented additional security measures, including state of the art cyber monitoring on its network, the organization said. In addition to the identity and credit protection services from Equifax, the pediatrics group recommended that patients also place a fraud alert on their credit files.", "sourcefile": "10054.txt",
