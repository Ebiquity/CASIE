{"content": "A new variant of the IoT/Linux botnet \u201cTsunami\u201d has been identified by Unit 42 researchers, according to a blog post by Palo Alto Networks. Co-authored by Claud Xiao, Cong Zheng and Yanhui Jia, the post names the new variant as Amnesia, a botnet that targets an unpatched remote code execution vulnerability. This vulnerability was publicly disclosed over a year ago in March 2016 in DVR (digital video recorder) devices made by TVT Digital and branded by over 70 vendors across the globe. This unpatched remote code execution vulnerability affects about 227,000 devices around the world especially Taiwan, the United States, Israel, Turkey, and India. The researchers note that the Amnesia malware is the first Linux malware to adopt virtual machine evasion techniques to defeat malware analysis sandboxes.\u00a0 \u00a0Typically, these virtual machine evasion techniques are more commonly associated with Microsoft Windows and Google Android malware.\u00a0 Amnesia aims to detect whether it\u2019s running in a VirtualBox, VMware or QEMU-based virtual machine. Once these environments are detected, Amnesia will wipe the virtualized Linux system by deleting all the files in file system.\u00a0 Eventually the deletion will impact Linux malware analysis sandboxes and also some QEMU-based Linux servers on VPS or on public cloud.\u00a0 Although the Amnesia botnet hasn\u2019t yet been used to mount large scale attacks, it has the potential to cause large-scale harm using IoT-based botnets.", "sourcefile": "1776.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "relation": "Same", "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 328, "index": "T2", "endOffset": 350, "text": "was publicly disclosed"}, "argument": [{"index": "T1", "text": "This vulnerability", "endOffset": 327, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 309, "type": "Vulnerability"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "over a year ago", "endOffset": 366, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 351, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T4", "text": "March 2016", "endOffset": 380, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 370, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T5", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Digital_video_recorder", "wikidataid": "Q865042"}, "endOffset": 420, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "text": "DVR (digital video recorder) devices", "startOffset": 384, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T6", "external_reference": {"dbpediaURI": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/TVT_Records", "wikidataid": "Q2283665"}, "endOffset": 440, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System_Owner"}, "text": "TVT Digital", "startOffset": 429, "type": "Organization"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"index": "E2", "type": "Vulnerability-related", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 541, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 548, "text": "affects"}, "argument": [{"index": "T9", "text": "devices", "endOffset": 570, "role": {"type": "Vulnerable_System"}, "startOffset": 563, "type": "Device"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "This unpatched remote code execution vulnerability", "endOffset": 540, "role": {"type": "Vulnerability"}, "startOffset": 490, "type": "Vulnerability"}], "subtype": "DiscoverVulnerability"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Researchers identify new variant of IoT/Linux botnet", "date": "2017_04_20", "type": "text", "link": "https://www.mis-asia.com/resource/internet/researchers-identify-new-variant-of-iotlinux-botnet/"}}
