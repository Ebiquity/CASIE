{"content": "The SANS Internet Storm Center published a warning on Wednesday about\u00a0an active phishing campaign that utilizes PDF attachments in a novel ploy to harvest email credentials from victims. According to the SANS bulletin,\u00a0the email has the subject line \u201cAssessment document\u201d and the body contains a single PDF attachment that claims to be locked. A message reads: \u201cPDF Secure File UNLOCK to Access File Content\u201d. Clicking on a link to unlock the document opens the PDF document using the computer\u2019s default viewer. A dialogue box then appears above the PDF prompting the user to input their email address and password. They are not going after the most sophisticated users. They are going after Joe Cubicle that may not think twice about entering credentials to unlock a PDF,\u201d said John Bambenek, handler at SANS Internet Storm Center. Bambenek suspects that attackers are harvesting credentials in hopes of gaining a small foothold into a company via an email account or to perpetuate further phishing scams. The email says it\u2019s from VetMeds and the PDF is identified as a VetMeds assessment. Once opened, the contents of the one-page PDF indicates that the document is a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) banking transaction. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what email address or password you input into the fake unlocking mechanism. The document is opened and anything you input is transmitted to the spammer,\u201d Bambenek said.", "sourcefile": "84.txt", "cyberevent": {"hopper": [{"index": 0, "events": [{"index": "E1", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 80, "index": "T1", "endOffset": 97, "text": "phishing campaign"}, "argument": [{"index": "T4", "text": "utilizes PDF attachments", "endOffset": 127, "role": {"CAPEC-Meta": "Excavation", "type": "Attack-Pattern", "confidence": 0.8905539512634277}, "startOffset": 103, "type": "Capabilities"}, {"index": "T2", "text": "Wednesday", "endOffset": 63, "role": {"type": "Time"}, "startOffset": 54, "type": "Time"}, {"index": "T3", "text": "a novel ploy", "endOffset": 143, "role": {"type": "Trusted-Entity"}, "startOffset": 131, "type": "File"}, {"index": "T5", "text": "harvest email credentials", "endOffset": 172, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Gathering data", "confidence": 0.8596126437187195}, "startOffset": 147, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T6", "text": "victims", "endOffset": 185, "role": {"type": "Victim"}, "startOffset": 178, "type": "Person"}], "subtype": "Phishing"}]}, {"index": 1, "events": [{"index": "E4", "type": "Attack", "realis": "Actual", "nugget": {"startOffset": 866, "index": "T8", "endOffset": 880, "text": "are harvesting"}, "argument": [{"index": "T14", "text": "credentials", "endOffset": 892, "role": {"type": "Compromised-Data"}, "startOffset": 881, "type": "PII"}, {"index": "T13", "text": "attackers", "endOffset": 865, "role": {"type": "Attacker"}, "startOffset": 856, "type": "Person"}, {"index": "T9", "text": "gaining a small foothold into a company", "endOffset": 944, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Unauthorized access", "confidence": 0.9840472042560577}, "startOffset": 905, "type": "Purpose"}, {"index": "T7", "text": "perpetuate further phishing scams", "endOffset": 1005, "role": {"type": "Purpose", "subtype": "Further attack", "confidence": 0.9765546917915344}, "startOffset": 972, "type": "Purpose"}], "subtype": "Databreach"}]}]}, "info": {"title": "Experts Warn of Novel PDF-based Phishing Scam | Threatpost | The first stop for security news", "date": "2017_01_06", "type": "text", "link": "https://threatpost.com/experts-warn-of-novel-pdf-based-phishing-scam/122896/"}}
