It is – or it should be – a well known fact that attackers occasionally email potential victims with PDF attachments containing malware or exploit code.
But the latest attacks through PDF attachments are geared towards pushing users to enter their email account credentials into well-crafted phishing pages.
Microsoft security experts saw a lot of variants of the same attack, and they all start with spoofed emails supposedly delivering asked-for documents.
In one variation, the PDF makes it look like there has been an error, and the document can only be displayed with Microsoft Excel.
But instead of actually opening it with their own software, potential victims are urged to open it by following the link offered in the PDF:
If they do that, they will be redirected to a web page that makes it seem like the document can only be opened if the user signs in with their email credentials.
In another variant, the PDF urges users to click on a link that will supposedly allow them to view a Dropbox-hosted document online.
“Social engineering attacks are designed to take advantage of possible lapses in decision-making.
Awareness is key; that is why we’re making these cybercriminal tactics known,” Microsoft’s Alden Pornasdoro explained.
“In these times, when we’re seeing heightened phishing attacks with improved social engineering techniques, a little bit of paranoia doesn’t hurt.
For instance, question why Adobe Reader is trying to open an Excel file.
