The Equifax data breach in which millions of Americans had their personal details stolen may have been carried out by a foreign government in a bid to recruit U.S. spies, experts believe. 
Hackers took addresses, dates of birth, Social Security details and credit card numbers from 148million people when they targeted the credit ratings giant Equifax in 2017. 
But the stolen data has not appeared on any 'dark web' sites which sell personal information for sinister use, analysts have said. 
The data's apparent disappearance has led some experts to conclude that it is in the hands of a foreign government, CNBC reported.
One analyst told the channel: 'We are all working to be able to consistently determine whether this data is out there and whether it has ever been out there.
And at this time there has been absolutely no indication, whatsoever, that the data has been disclosed, that it has been used or that it has been offered for sale.
Another ex-intelligence worker said personal data could be used by foreign governments to identify powerful people who were having financial problems.
Those people would be prime targets for a bribe or might be attracted by a job offer, he said. 
It has also been suggested that the criminals who stole the data feared detection if they sold it online and have kept it to themselves to avoid capture.   
Equifax, one of America's three leading consumer reporting agencies, announced the huge data hack in September 2017 and its CEO Richard Smith resigned later that month.
They initially said 143million people had been affected but the number eventually grew to 148million, equivalent to nearly half the U.S. population. 
The hackers targeted the company for 76 days until the attack was spotted, according to a congressional report.  
Hackers gained access to 48 databases between May 13 and July 29 when Equifax noticed the intrusion, the report said.   
Last year the firm admitted that passport images and information had also been stolen. 
The U.S. House committee which investigated the breach said the firm had 'failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks'. 
'Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues prior to this cyberattack, the data breach could have been prevented,' the committee's report said.
