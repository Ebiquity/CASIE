A coalition of some of the globe’s top researchers and cryptographers are pleading with The Guardian to retract a story it published last week in which it suggested the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp contained a backdoor.
The article, citing research by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher, accused WhatsApp of having a backdoor    that it or Facebook could use to eavesdrop on user messages.
The article, published by the media group last Friday, was almost immediately met with criticism, first from WhatsApp – which called the allegations false – then from a collection of researchers who also refuted the claims.
