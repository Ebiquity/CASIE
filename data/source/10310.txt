Scammers taking advantage of tax time are trying to trick Australians into handing over their personal details with the promise of a tax refund through a fake myGov form.
Stay Safe Online issued a high alert for the latest scam on Wednesday.
"It's tax time and the common scam email informing that you're eligible for a tax refund is doing the rounds again," the warning said.
"Scammers have long used the promise of a tax refund to trick people into sharing their personal information or to download malware."
The phishing email claims to come from myGov and has the subject line, "Important information regarding your account", as well as the myGov logo.
It asks you to click on a link to claim your refund.
The link leads to a fake tax refund claim form, asking for personal details such as email, password, and credit card details.
"After you supply this information and click the continue button, you'll be automatically redirected to the myGov website. By then it's too late and the scammer has your details."
Stay Safe Online said scammers can use that information to commit credit card fraud and identity theft.
"The ATO and myGov will never send an email or SMS asking you to click on a link and provide login, personal or financial information, download a file or open an attachment."
Earlier this month scammers used a cloned version of myGov website in an attempt to lure in victims with a phishing email.
Australian Taxation Office assistant commissioner Kath Anderson said tax time was a popular time for scammers to prey on unsuspecting Australians, busily preparing their tax returns or even waiting on a refund.
