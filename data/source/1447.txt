Many people at GC are receiving one of the more popular phishing scam emails.
It appears to be from Microsoft, a “Security Alert” wanting you to revalidate your account.
If you did click on the email, please reset you Unify password (and subsequent email password) at password.gcsu.edu.­­­­­­­­­­­­
We think that someone else might have accessed the Microsoft account ********@gcsu.edu.
When this happens we require you to verify your identity with a security challenge and then change your password the next time you sign in.
If someone else has access to your account, they have your password and might be trying to access your personal information or send junk email.
