Yesterday, researcher Simon Kenin of Trustwave SpiderLabs released information about an authentication bypass flaw affecting a wide variety of Netgear routers, as well as PoC attack code for triggering it.
The vulnerability (CVE-2017-5521) can be exploited by attackers to discover the password required to take over control of an affected device.
“The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN,” he explained.
“When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate, if the authentication is cancelled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is  redirected to a page which exposes a password recovery token.
If a user supplies the correct token to the page http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router”.
He discovered the vulnerability almost a year ago, but revealed it only now because Netgear has been slow to push out fixed firmware for affected devices.
“In June [2016] Netgear published a notice that provided a fix for a small subset of vulnerable routers and a workaround for the rest.
They also made the commitment to working toward 100% coverage for all affected routers,” he noted.
“The notice has been updated several time since then and currently contains 31 vulnerable models, 18 of which are patched now, and 2 models that they previously listed as vulnerable, but are now listed as not vulnerable.
In fact, our tests show that one of the models listed as not vulnerable (DGN2200v4) is, in fact, vulnerable and this can easily be reproduced with the POC provided in our advisory”.
Trustwave found over 10,000 remotely accessible vulnerable devices, and estimates that there are many more non-remotely accessible affected devices in use – possibly even a million.
