Remember when all you had to worry about with your car is getting an oil change every 3,000 miles.
Today’s connected cars are miles ahead technologically speaking of those “dumb” vehicles, but drivers could see a bumpy ride if thieves get a hold of the data the car possesses.
The Internet of Things (IoT) has created an entirely new market in the automotive industry with connected car services that are driving new recurring revenue growth and transforming the industry.
And that trajectory is expected to continue, growing from $13.6 to top $42 billion by 2022.
Vehicles contain critical personal information such as personal contacts, registration and insurance details, financial information and even the address to the owner's home – making entry, theft and further damage even more of a possibility.
Vehicles have become an extension of one’s connected self and the technology associated with them offers substantial benefits.
With the emergence of sophisticated technology, the nature of vehicle theft has changed.
A major adversary of today’s vehicle owner is a smarter, connected and more targeted network of criminals, known as ‘Connected Vehicle Thieves’.
LoJack, provider of vehicle theft recovery and advanced fleet management solutions, shows how these New Age thieves can take advantage of the technology in vehicles.
Vehicle-enabled ransom: One growing and increasingly lucrative type of cybercrime is the use of ransomware, where inserted malware encrypts digital data and instructs a victim to pay the criminal a ransom to restore the decrypted information.
With the emergence of the connected car and vehicles being used as WiFi hot spots, vehicle-enabled ransomware is a predictable next step for hackers, exploiting this new avenue to commit digital “kidnapping”.
For example, in the near future, they could easily break into a vehicle, disable the engine and brakes, and demand bitcoin to restore the car to its functional state.
Scanner boxes as smart keys: Thieves have begun carrying scanner boxes, or devices that can exploit the electronic system utilized by key fobs.
These criminals can then unlock, and even start, a vehicle without even touching the key.
Once the key comes in close enough range to the scanner box and is compromised.
Data leading to identity theft: These days, connected cars carry more information and personal data than ever before, making identity theft a more serious threat.
Thieves are targeting your vehicle, but also the data within it, which could lead to credit card details, location information, Social Security numbers, and personal IDs like drivers’ licenses.
Once this information is obtained, it’s possible for a hacker to access any of your online accounts.
