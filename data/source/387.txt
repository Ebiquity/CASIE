The big security issue of the week is a remote code execution hole related to the Cisco WebEx service.
WebEx is a popular collaboration tool for online events such as meetings, webinars and videoconferences.
Like many services of this sort, you access online events via your browser, augmented by a special-purpose browser extension.
Browser extensions and plugins allow web developers to extend the software features inside your browser with a mixture of scripts and program code, for example to add configuration options or to support new audio and video formats.
Of course, when you add  another layer of programmatic complexity on top of an already-complex browser, it’s easy to add new security holes, too.
Perhaps the best known example of a problematic plugin is Adobe Flash, which has provided cybercrooks with such a fruitful source of exploitable security holes over the years that we have long been urging you to try to live without Flash altogether.
The latest security scare of this sort has been dubbed CVE-2017-3823, and it applies to Cisco’s special-purpose WebEx browser extension.
In oher words, if your organisation uses WebEx, you probably have the browser extension installed, and if you have it installed, you may be at risk.
According to Tavis Ormandy at Google’s Project Zero, who discovered and documented the bug, there are more than 20 million WebEx users worldwide.
According to Cisco, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox on Windows are affected.
Microsoft Edge on Windows and all browsers on Mac and Linux are safe.
The most recent update for Chrome is Cisco WebEx extension 1.0.7.
Cisco published a notification about this update at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, having issued and then withdrawn 1.0.3 and then 1.0.5 earlier this week after deeming them “incomplete”.
However, at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, Cisco’s official Security Advisory page says:
Cisco is currently developing updates that address this vulnerability for Firefox and Internet Explorer.
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
Using Microsoft Edge on Windows or any browser on Mac or Linux will shield you from this bug because it doesn’t apply on those platforms.
You can also turn off WebEx support in your browser temporarily, thus preventing the Cisco extension or add-on from activating unexpectedly.
