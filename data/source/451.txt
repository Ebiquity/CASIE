A longtime Debian developer has recommended that the Cryptkeeper Linux encryption app be removed from the distribution.
The advice came after the disclosure of a bug where the app sets the universal password “p” to decrypt any directory created with the program.
Simon McVittie, a programmer at Collabora, confirmed the findings of researcher Kirill Tkhai, who disclosed the bug Jan. 26.
McVittie said he was able to reproduce the bug in the Stretch version (Debian 9, in testing), but not in the Jessie version (Debian 8).
“I have recommended that the release team remove this package from stretch: it currently gives a false sense of security that is worse than not encrypting at all,” McVittie said in response to the original bug report.
Francesco Namuri, another Debian developer, agreed the Cryptkeeper packages should be yanked from Debian.
Tkhai’s advisory said Cryptkeeper version 0.9.5-5.1 is affected.
The problem appears when Cryptkeeper calls encfs, a command line interface for the encrypted file system.
Encfs simulates a ‘p’ keystroke but the uses it instead as a universal password.
