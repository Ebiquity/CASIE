Sucuri, the company that discovered the flaw and responsibly reported it to the WordPress security team, spotted four distinct defacement campaigns in the 48 hours after the existence of the bug was publicly revealed.
Three of them have had limited impact, but one – “signed” by someone that goes by “w4l3XzY3” – has resulted in the compromise of 86,000 pages and counting.
Sucuri CTO Daniel Cid expects the defacement campaigns to slow down in the coming days, only to be followed by SEO spam (Search Engine Poisoning) attempts.
“There’s already a few exploit attempts that try to add spam images and content to a post.
Due to the monetization possibilities, this will likely be the #1 route to abuse this vulnerability,” he noted.
