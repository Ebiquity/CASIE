Grupo Folha is the third largest Brazilian media conglomerate whilst Universo Online (UOL) is a web content, products and services Brazilian firm.
However, it is still unclear who was behind the whole scheme.
The deface message itself was asking users to click on a cat to read groupâ€™s background but upon clicking, they were redirected to RedTube.
