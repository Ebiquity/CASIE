Networked printers for years have left gaping holes in home and office network security.
Today, experts continue to find flaws in popular laser printers, which are putting businesses at risk.
Experts at the University Alliance Ruhr recently announced vulnerabilities in laser printers from manufacturers including Dell, HP, Lexmark, Samsung, Brother, and Konica.
The flaws could permit print docs to be captured, allow buffer overflow exploits, disclose passwords, or cause printer damage.
Up to 60,000 currently deployed printers could be vulnerable, they estimate.
When unprotected, printers expose users to several types of attacks, says Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne.
Hackers can use vulnerabilities to capture old printer logs, which may contain sensitive information.
They may also use these flaws to establish their foothold in a networked device and move laterally throughout the organization to gather data.
Some attackers want to wreak havoc outside a single business.
With networked printers under their control, a cybercriminal may use one company's bandwidth to perform DDoS attacks on other organizations and individuals around the world.
These examples are among the many types of damage that will continue to threaten security as part of the growing Internet of Things, Grossman predicts.
"Most of the time, printers are not going to be terribly different from any IoT device," he explains.
Hackers who find vulnerabilities in the web interface can take over, as they could for any device connected to the network.
The difference, of course, is printers have been around far longer than most IoT products.
This presents a market failure that will be difficult to correct because patches won't be made available.
Even when they are, devices won't be patched often.
Right now the easiest vectors include web hacking and email attacks, but they will move to IoT as computers and operating systems get more secure.
Printers are low-hanging fruit, he says, and easier to target.
He also recommends isolating printers on local networks, separate from PCs, and disabling out-of-network communication so even if they're hacked, printers can't interact with adversaries outside the organization.
Wingate suggests adopting the same baseline security practices businesses employ for computers; for example, periodically update passwords so sensitive content isn't left in the open for people to steal.
He also recommends intrusion detection, another practice people use for their PCs but don't frequently employ on printers.
