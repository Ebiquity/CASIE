Android users were the target of new banking malware with screen locking capabilities, which was disguised as a weather forecast app on Google Play.
Detected by ESET as Trojan.Android/Spy.Banker.HU, the malware was a trojanized version of the otherwise benign weather forecast application Good Weather.
The malicious app managed to get around Google’s security mechanisms and appeared in the store on February 4th, only to be reported by ESET two days later and consequently pulled from the store.
During its short lifetime, the app found its way to devices of up to 5000 users.
Besides the weather forecast functionalities it adopted from the original legitimate application, the trojan is able to lock and unlock infected devices remotely and intercept text messages.
Apart from doing so, the trojan targeted the users of 22 Turkish mobile banking apps, whose credentials were harvested using phony login forms.
The infected device then displays a fake system screen requesting device administrator rights on behalf of fictitious “System update”.
By enabling these rights, the victim allows the malware to Change the screen-unlock password and Lock the screen.
Users who are not alarmed at this point might be pleased with the new weather widget they can add to their home screens.
However, in the background, the malware is getting to work sharing device information with its C&C server.
Depending on the command it gets in return, it can intercept received text messages and send them to the server, remotely lock and unlock the device by setting a lock screen password of the attackers’ choice, and harvest banking credentials.
The trojan displays a fake login screen once the user runs one of the targeted banking apps and sends entered data to the attacker.
Thanks to the permission to intercept the victims’ text messages, the malware is also able to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication.
As for the device locking, we suspect this function enters the picture when cashing out the compromised bank account, to keep the fraudulent activity hidden from the user.
Once locked out, all victims can do is wait until the malware receives a command to unlock the device.
If you’ve recently installed a weather app from the Play Store, you might want to check if you haven’t been one of the victims of this banking trojan.
In case you think you might have downloaded an app named Good Weather, check for its icon under your apps.
After running anything you’ve installed on your mobile device, keep paying attention to what permissions and rights it requests.
An app that won’t run without advanced permissions that aren’t connected to its intended function might be an app you don’t want installed on your phone.
