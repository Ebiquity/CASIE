Facebook is dismissing claims by a researcher who says multimedia content such as audio-based messages sent via its Facebook Messenger service can be intercepted by a third-party under certain conditions.
On Tuesday, Mohamed Baset, a security analyst at ecommerce firm Linio México, published a proof-of-concept video demonstrating what he calls a Facebook flaw that allows an attacker to access audio or video files from Facebook servers and play them back.
Facebook is dismissing Baset’s claims, telling Threatpost, “We appreciate researcher reports, but this is not a flaw and does not impact the normal functioning of voice clips on Messenger”.
Baset concedes that the alleged threat he illustrates represents a “narrow attack surface” and is “not really that dangerous for most users”.
