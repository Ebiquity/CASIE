Anyone who uses the popular Cisco WebEx extension for Chrome should update to the latest version pronto.
Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy recently discovered a serious vulnerability in the Chrome extension that leaves PCs wide open to attack.
The magic string was designed to remotely activate the WebEx browser extension.
Once the extension was activated the bad guys could execute malicious code on the target machine.
The impact on you at home: It’s a good idea for anyone who uses this extension to make sure it’s updated to the latest version given the severity of the vulnerability.
It’s not clear if version 1.0.5 offers any significant protection against the threat Ormandy describes.
Apparently, all version 1.0.3 did was offer a pop-up anytime that magic code was used, according to Cloudfare security researcher Filippo Valsorda.
That puts the onus on the user to make sure they really want to be using WebEx when that pop-up appears.
If you’d rather not bother with the extension it’s also possible to use a temporary, downloadable desktop program each time you want to use WebEx.
That may not be convenient, but it’s an alternative.
Ormandy’s discovery raised enough eyebrows that Mozilla blocked WebEx for Firefox.
