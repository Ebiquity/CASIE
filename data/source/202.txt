A recent lull in the distribution of spam spreading information-stealing malware via the Hancitor downloader has been snapped.
Researchers at the SANS Internet Storm Center are currently tracking an increase in spam purporting to be a forwarded parking ticket notification.
The message prompts the recipient to click a link to pay a parking ticket; the hyperlink is to a Microsoft Word document.
“The document contains a malicious VB macro described has Hancitor, Chanitor or Tordal,” wrote Brad Duncan, handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center in blog post warning of the spam campaign.
“If you enable macros, the document retrieves a Pony downloader DLL.
The Pony downloader then retrieves and installs Vawtrak malware”.
