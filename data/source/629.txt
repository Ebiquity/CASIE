Recent attacks against insecure MongoDB, Hadoop and CouchDB installations represent a new phase in online extortion, born from ransomware’s roots with the promise of becoming a nemesis for years to come.
First spotted on Dec. 27 by Victor Gevers, an ethical hacker and founder of GDI Foundation, attacks in the past two months shot up from 200 to near 50,000.
The first of these ransom attacks against insecure databases traces back to a hacker identified as Harak1r1, who Gevers said was responsible for compromising open MongoDB installations, deleting their contents, and leaving behind a ransom note demanding 0.2 BTC (about $220 at the time).
After that, escalation of attacks against open MongoDB installations happened fast, jumping from hundreds one week, to 2,000 the next, and 10,000 the following week.
At last count more than 56,000 open MongoDB databases alone are ripe for attack, according to the most recent numbers available from GDI Foundation.
But that doesn’t include a slew of new databases now being targeted by cybercriminals.
Security researchers at Rapid7 estimate that 50 percent of the 56,000 vulnerable MongoDB servers have been ransomed.
In a typical ransomware attack, an attacker compromises a computer via malware or Trojan and encrypts local data that can only be unlocked with an encryption key obtained for a price.
That spurred a maturing of ransomware used against more sophisticated healthcare, government and educational targets with similar phishing, malware and Trojan techniques.
However, experts say, both have acted as the stepping stones to this type of data hijacking.
With data hijacking, attackers compromise insecure database installations, copy data, then delete the contents and leaving behind a ransom note in the form of a directory name demanding a ransom be paid via Bitcoin.
Rapid7 has already seen additional databases such as Redis, Kibana and other SQL databases targeted in its honeypots.
Josh Gomez, senior security researcher with security firm Anomali, said moving forward attacks will be less random, more targeted and seek high-value repositories with weak protection.
