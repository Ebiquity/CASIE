A Windows zero-day bug has made the news. By zero-day, it means that a vulnerability has been exposed but it is not yet patched. Darren Allan in TechRadar was one of the tech watchers reporting on the vulnerability, which could occur through a privilege escalation bug.
"The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability," said Charlie Osborne in ZDNet.
"CERT/CC (the US cybersecurity organization which looks to counter emerging threats) has confirmed that this vulnerability can be leveraged against a 64-bit Windows 10 PC which has been fully patched up to date, " said TechRadar, in turn referring to a story in The Register,
Richard Chergwin, The Register, had reported that "CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann quickly verified the bug."
CERT/CC did a formal investigation, and posted an advisory. "'Microsoft Windows task scheduler contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC, which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges,' the alert stated."
This can be leveraged to gain SYSTEM privileges. We have confirmed that the public exploit code works on 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems. We have also confirmed compatibility with 32-bit Windows 10 with minor modifications to the public exploit code. Compatibility with other Windows versions is possible with further modifications."
Should we worry? Allan said it is a local bug. The attacker would have to be already logged into the PC to exploit it, or be running code on the machine.
But wait. Though local, Ars Technica's Peter Bright let its readers know what the flaw allows one to do. Not pretty.
Bright wrote that "The flaw allows anyone with the ability to run code on a system to elevate their privileges to 'SYSTEM' level, the level used by most parts of the operating system and the nearest thing that Windows has to an all-powerful superuser."
Osborne in ZDNet said that while the impact was limited, "the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant."
