News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services.
Addresses, names and phone numbers for staff were accessed in the data breach
SPORTS Direct failed to tell its workers about a major data breach that saw personal information accessed by hackers.
A cyber attacker gained access to internal systems containing details for phone numbers, names and home and email addresses of the retail giant's 30,000 staff members.
But according to The Register, workers still haven't been told about the breach, which took place in September.
Sports Direct discovered the attack three months later after a phone number was left on the company's internal site with a message encouraging bosses to make contact.
Chiefs filed a report with the Information Commissioner's office after it became aware that personal information had been compromised.
But as there was no evidence the data had been shared, Sports Direct didn't report the breach to staff.
The blunder is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the sporting goods retailer.
Allegations also surfaced of some workers being promised permanent contracts in exchange for sexual favours.
Committee chairman Iain Wright said evidence heard by MPs last year suggested Sports Direct's working practices "are closer to that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable High Street retailer".
In November, six MPs from the Business and Skills Committee said attempts were made to record their private discussions when they visited Sport Direct to investigate working practices.
A spokesman for Sports Direct said: "We cannot comment on operational matters in relation to cyber-security for obvious reasons.
