An official in a small Michigan county has resigned after being tricked into wiring $50,000 to an overseas bank account.
Shiawassee County apparently was the victim of a phishing scam. Financial administrator Patricia Fitnich believed she was replying to an email from another county official about paying a bill for research and development.
The money was supposed to go to a bank in Texas, according to Commissioner Daniel McMaster, but actually was transferred to a South African bank.
A county administrator, Michael Herendeen, confirmed to TV5 Fitnich had "done a number of fine things" over two years but she realized "this was a major mistake."
