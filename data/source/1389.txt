“Over the past several weeks, we have seen a combination of attack techniques.
One, where an attacker impersonates a travel agency or someone inside a company.
Recipients are told an email contains an airline ticket or e-ticket,” said Asaf Cidon, vice president, content security services at Barracuda Networks.
Attachments, he said, are documents rigged with malware or are designed to download it from a command and control server.
Cidon said other aviation-themed phishing attacks contain links to spoofed airline sites.
In these types of attacks, adversaries go to great lengths to spoof the airline’s site.
“It’s clear there is some degree of advanced reconnaissance that takes place before targeting individuals within these companies,” Cidon said.
Recent phishing campaigns, he said, are targeting logistic, shipping and manufacturing industries.
Barracuda’s warning comes a week after the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued an alert of similar attacks targeting airline consumers.
It warned email-based phishing campaigns were attempting to obtain credentials as well.
“Systems infected through phishing campaigns act as an entry point for attackers to gain access to sensitive business or personal information,” according to the US-CERT warning.
Delta said some victims were sent emails that claimed to contain invoices or receipts inside attached documents.
When asked about the warning, Delta declined to comment.
More troubling to Barracuda researchers was the success rate adversaries are having with phishing campaigns it is tracking.
“Our analysis shows that for the airline phishing attack, attackers are successful over 90 percent of the time in getting employees to open airline impersonation emails,” Cidon wrote in a research note posted Thursday.
“This is one of the highest success rates for phishing attacks”.
In June, Microsoft Malware Protection Center reported a resurgence in the use of Office document macro attacks.
Researchers say crooks attempting to install malware and perpetrate credential-harvesting attacks are more likely to use social engineering to trick people into installing malware than to exploit vulnerabilities with tools such as exploit kits.
