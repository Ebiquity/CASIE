The executive director of the organization revealed on Tuesday that their computer systems have been infected with a ransomware by cyber criminals who happen to be “an international cyber terrorist organization”.
Aimee Fant, the Executive Director of Little Red Door, officially revealed its involvement in the agency’s computer system hack in a press release.
According to their Facebook post, the attack occurred last week on Wednesday night when the hackers attacked the terminal service and backup driver of Cancer Services’ computer systems.
They managed to access, hack and encrypt the data.
After carrying out the hack attack, the notorious gang of cyber criminals demanded $43,000 ransom on Thursday.
The press release also revealed that the perpetrators of the crime were gearing up to threaten the family members of living or deceased “cancer clients, donors and community partners”.
She further informed that the FBI has been contacted to conduct an “active investigation”.
It is worth noting that a majority of the agency’s data is stored in cloud storage.
Perhaps, this is why the organization is not willing to pay the ransom and believes that “all funds raised must go to serving families, all stage cancer patients, late stage care/hospice support and preventative screenings,” instead of cyber criminals.
