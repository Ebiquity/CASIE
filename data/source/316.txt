Approximately 560,000 people were affected by a flaw in the script used to migrate followers to the new archival handles.
"If you were following @POTUS before 12pET, by end of day you'd be following *two* accounts: @POTUS44 (44th Admin) and @POTUS (45th Admin)," Dorsey tweeted.
Dorsey apologized for the mistake, and said Twitter has worked to correct the issue.
He did add, however, that the Obama Administration felt it was fair to automatically migrate followers after the transition, since @POTUS is an institutional account.
One of the most visible transfers of executive power happened today on Twitter.
The official @POTUS account was handed off to President Trump, and former-President Obama re-assumed his personal handle, @BarackObama.
(Trump predictably continued to tweet from his personal account long into the inauguration, however.)
Michelle and I are off on a quick vacation, then we'll get back to work.
But some Twitter users are complaining that despite never following @POTUS in the first place, the presidential handle is suddenly showing up in their timelines.
Somehow, they claim, Twitter had automatically followed it for them.

"I specifically UNFOLLOWED this account earlier today.
Yet now I am following it again without having resubscribed," one user tweeted.
"@POTUS turned up in my feed despite me not following, willingly or otherwise," said another person.
A spokesperson for Twitter told Motherboard they couldn't comment on these specific claims, but said that post-inauguration, Twitter automatically migrated the followers of @POTUS over to the newly created @POTUS44 account, which acts as an archive for President Obama's tweets.
The same was done for @FLOTUS44, belonging to Michelle Obama, and @VP44, belonging to former-Vice President Biden.
As you can see, both versions have somewhat similar follower counts.
