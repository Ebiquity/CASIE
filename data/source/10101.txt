HACKERS connected with last week’s devastating NotPetya cyber attack have offered help — but it comes at a price.
HACKERS connected with the ransomware that devastated overseas banks, power stations, and even Cadbury factories in Australia last week have issued a new ransom demand — and it’s for much more money than before.
The new ransom note was published in two places on the Dark Web and demanded a payment of 100 Bitcoins, or about $340,000, in return for a private security key that could decrypt any file locked by the Petya/Goldeneye malware.
The hackers even opened a chat room and offered to decrypt one file for potential buyers as proof that the key would work, though it’s not clear whether this was a bluff.
The demand was a significant increase on the ransomware’s initial request for just less than $400 in Bitcoin when the malware was launched in the Ukraine last Tuesday before rapidly spreading through computer networks worldwide.
Bitcoin transactions show its creators were able to access more than $13,000 paid by victims, however, even though their email address was suspended by its German provider.
It’s not known whether victims who paid the ransom received a security key to unlock their files.
The dangerous ransomware affected as many as 16,000 computers in 64 countries, according to security firm Clavister, and crippled the operations of several European companies.
Some Australian businesses were also affected through their international connections, including Cadbury factories in Tasmania and Victoria, TNT Express courier services, and the offices of law firm DLA Piper.
The demand or money came amid growing speculation that the ransomware was not designed to make a profit, but was a form of digital terrorism or industrial espionage.
ESET senior research fellow Nick FitzGerald said the Petya malware was designed to kill computers first, and ask for money second.
“(Being ransomware) was a mechanism to help hide the trail of a gang of cyber terrorists or spies,” he said.
Mr FitzGerald advised victims not to pay any ransom as there was very little chance they would be able to unlock their files.
