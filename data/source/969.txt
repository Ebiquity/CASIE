For many people, the revelation that the US Central Intelligence Agency has been systematically hacking into civilians' personal devices is profoundly disturbing.
"While exploits across a range of devices and the ability to turn on cameras and microphones is a touch chilling, they're nothing new, and anyone with real concerns should already be going about their business with those possibilities in mind," he said.
Meanwhile, Ilia Kolochenko from web security firm High-Tech Bridge said he was "surprised" that the incident had attracted so much attention.
"The CIA, like any other governmental intelligence agency, uses and will continue using various hacking tools and techniques to obtain any information they need to protect the country.
"So far, we don't have any evidence that these capacities were used unlawfully, for example to violate reasonable expectation of privacy of innocent US citizens or for illicit interference with elections."
