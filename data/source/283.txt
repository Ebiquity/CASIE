According to Fortinet researcher Kai Lu, the one who discovered this new threat, the ransomware appears to be targeting only Russian-speaking users, as its ransom note is only available in Russian.
A translated version of the ransom note is available below.
There are several things that stand out about this threat.
The first is the humongous ransom demand it asks victims for, which is 545,000 Russian rubles (~$9,100).
This ransom demand is between 10 and 100 times over the price of some phones, and most users who can't remove the screen locker will instead choose to buy a new phone rather than paying the crooks.
To pay the ransom, victims have to enter their credit card number directly in the ransom screen, a technique very different from how other ransomware operators like to work, which is via Bitcoin, Tor, or gift cards.
The other thing that sets this ransomware apart is the usage of the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform, now renamed in Firebase Cloud Messaging.
