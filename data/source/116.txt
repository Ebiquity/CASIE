On Tuesday 2017-01-03, BleepingComputer published an article about "Merry X-Mas Ransomware".
This ransomware was first seen by people like @PolarToffee, @dvk01uk, and @Techhelplistcom.
Merry X-Mas Ransomware was first reported as distributed through malicious spam (malspam) disguised as FTC consumer complaints.
By Sunday 2017-01-08, I saw an updated version of the Merry X-Mas Ransomware distributed through malspam disguised as court attendance notifications.
It seemed odd to find Christmas-themed ransomware two weeks after Christmas; however, Orthodox Christian communities celebrate Christmas on January 7th.
Ultimately, such Christmas-themed ransomware isn't odd if it's from a Russian actor.
With that in mind, let's review the characteristics of Sunday's Merry X-Mas ransomware.
Show above:Â  Comparison of Merry X-mas ransomware notifications from 2017-01-03 and 2017-01-08.
The malspam was a fake notification to appear in court.
Email headers indicate the sender's address was spoofed, and the email came from a cloudapp.net domain associated with Microsoft.
The zip archive contained a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro.
If macros were enabled on the Word document, it downloaded and executed the ransomware.
