iOS 10.3, released to the public on Monday, patches a bug that allowed bad actors to use a JavaScript pop-up in Safari in an attempt to extort money from iOS users.
Security firm Lookout (via Ars Technica) said the scammers would target Safari users who viewed pornography by placing malicious scripts on various pornographic website that would create an endless pop-up loop that basically locked the browser, if an uninformed user didn’t know how to get around the flaw.
    The scammers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be “locked” out from using Safari unless they paid a fee — or knew they could simply clear Safari’s cache (see next section). The attack was contained within the app sandbox of the Safari browser; no exploit code was used in this campaign, unlike an advanced attack like Pegasus that breaks out of the app sandbox to install malware on the device.
    The scammers registered domains and launched the attack from the domains they owned, such as police-pay[.]com, which the attackers apparently named with the intent of scaring users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money.
The pop-ups claimed to be from law-enforcement personnel, and claimed the only way to get control of the browser back was to pay a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card code delivered via text message. Users actually could have gotten out of the pop-up loop by manually clearing the Safari browser cache. However, a new or otherwise uninformed user might believe they actually needed to pay the ransom before regaining control of their browser.
“The attackers effectively used fear as a factor to get what they wanted before the victim realized that there was little actual risk,” Lookout researchers Andrew Blaich and Jeremy Richards said.
iOS 10.3 changes the way pop-up dialogs work in Safari. Previously, a pop-up dialog took over the entire Safari app. Now, pop-ups are only per tab. iOS users who are hit by the scam before updating to iOS 10.3 can clear their browsing cache by going to “Settings” -> “Safari” and tapping: “Clear History and Website Data.”
