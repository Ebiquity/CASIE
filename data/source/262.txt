MWR Labs researchers recently disclosed two high-security vulnerabilities in LG G3, G4, and G5 mobile devices.
The bugs include a Path Transversal flaw and an Arbitrary File Disclosure flaw, according to the respective security advisories.
The Path Transversal flaw was caused by the application not validating that URL parameters did not contain potentially malicious characters and could allow an attacker on the same network as a user to make any media file or folder shareable without authentication or user interaction.
The Arbitrary File Disclosure flaw was caused by the SmartShare.Cloud application launching an unauthenticated HTTP Server listening on all interfaces while connected to a WiFi network and could allow an attacker to retrieve any media file from the Cloud storage of the victim as long as they knew the file name.
Users are encouraged to ensure their devices are updated to the latest versions as Version 2.4.0 has mitigated the issues.
