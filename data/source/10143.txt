The bugs let hackers crash IoT devices, leak their information, and completely take them over.
Researchers have found that a popular Internet of Things real-time operating system – FreeRTOS – is riddled with serious vulnerabilities.
The bugs could allow hackers to crash connected devices in smart homes or critical infrastructure systems, leak information from the devices’ memory, and take them over. And while patches have been issued, researchers warn that it still may take time for smaller vendors to update.
Researcher Ori Karliner, with Zimperium’s zLabs team, recently analyzed some of the leading operating systems in the IoT market – including FreeRTOS, an open-source OS specifically designed for the microcontrollers that are within IoT devices. Within several versions of FreeRTOS, Karliner found 13 vulnerabilities enabling an array of attacks, including remote code execution, information leak and denial-of-service bugs.
“During our research, we discovered multiple vulnerabilities within FreeRTOS’s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules. The same vulnerabilities are present in WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\SafeRTOS,” according to a Thursday post by zLabs.
The vulnerabilities specifically exist in FreeRTOS’s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules (in as well as in the WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\SafeRTOS).
These vulnerabilities include four remote code execution bugs (CVE-2018-16522, CVE-2018-16525, CVE-2018-16526, and CVE-2018-16528); seven information leak vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16524, CVE-2018-16527, CVE-2018-16599, CVE-2018-16600, CVE-2018-16601, CVE-2018-16602, CVE-2018-16603) one denial of service flaw (CVE-2018-16523) and a final (CVE-2018-16598) that was unspecified.
zLabs said it has disclosed the security issues to Amazon and collaborated with them to patch the vulnerabilities. Those fixes were deployed for AWS FreeRTOS versions 1.3.2 and onwards. The vulnerabilities in RTOS WHIS were also patched.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost.
Due to the amount of vendors impacted by the bugs, the researchers said that they would hold off on publishing further details until all holes have been sealed.
