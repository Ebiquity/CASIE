Admins can now grab Cisco's updates for 13 high-severity flaws affecting gear that uses its IOS and IOS XE networking software.
All the bugs have been rated as having a high security impact because they could be used to gain elevated privileges or jam a device with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
The company also has fixes available for 11 more flaws outlined in 10 advisories with a medium-severity rating, most of which also address issues in IOS and IOS XE, the Linux-based train of Cisco's popular networking operating system.
The updates for the 13 high-severity IOS and IOS XE flaws are part of Cisco's scheduled twice-yearly patch bundle for this software targeted for September.
The company reported this week that some IOS XE releases were among 88 Cisco products vulnerable to the DoS attack on Linux systems known as FragmentSmack. 
And earlier this month it plugged a critical hard-coded password bug in its video surveillance software.
None of the flaws in the latest advisory is known to have been used in attacks and Cisco isn't aware of any public disclosures.
Some of the higher severity flaws include a DoS flaw affecting the IOS XE Web UI, which could allow a remote attacker to trigger a reload of the device by sending special HTTP requests to the UI.
An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this bug in IOS XE releases prior to 16.2.2, while 16.2.2 and later require authentication.
Another DoS flaw is rooted in the IPsec driver code of multiple Cisco IOS XE platforms and the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The buggy code improperly processes malformed IPsec Authentication Header (AH) or Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets.
"An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted ESP or AH packet that meets several other conditions, such as matching the IPsec SA SPI and being within the correct sequence window," notes Cisco.
This flaw affects six ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, and two 4000 Series Integrated Routers.
Cisco notes that its software is affected if the system has been modified from its default state and configured to terminate IPsec VPN connections, such as LAN-to-LAN VPN, and remote access VPN, but not SSL VPN.
