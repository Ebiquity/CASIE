Microsoft has quickly reacted to the disclosure of a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in the Windows operating system.
On Monday, Twitter user SandboxEscaper revealed the existence of the bug on the microblogging platform. As reported by the Register, the user said:
    "Here is the alpc bug as 0day. I don't f**king care about life anymore. Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway. F**k all of this shit."
The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability.
Following the disclosure, on Tuesday, Will Dormann, vulnerability analyst at CERT/CC verified the bug, adding that the zero-day flaw works "well in a fully-patched 64-bit Windows 10 system."
The Windows vulnerability is described as a local privilege escalation security flaw in the Microsoft Windows task scheduler caused by errors in the handling of Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) systems.
If exploited, the zero-day bug permits local users to obtain system privileges. As ALPC is a local system, the impact is limited, but the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant.
There are no known workarounds for the vulnerability, which has been awarded a CVSS score of 6.4 -- 6.8.
SandboxEscaper's tweet has since been deleted. However, Microsoft has acknowledged the zero-day flaw.
This is likely to take place on September 11, the next scheduled Microsoft Patch Tuesday, unless the firm decides to issue an out-of-schedule patch.
    "Windows has a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. Our standard policy is to provide solutions via our current Update Tuesday schedule."
