The boss of a company held to ransom by computer hackers is warning others not to fall victim.
Two years ago Stuart Kettell’s company Kettell Video Productions was targeted by hackers who encrypted all his files and demanded money to decrypt them.
Stuart Kettell may be best known for his light hearted charity fund raising challenges but this cyber attack was no joke.
The hackers infiltrated computer systems at the Warwick based company. They made it impossible for staff to see any of the company data and demanded £1,000 in online currency bitcoins to put matters right.
