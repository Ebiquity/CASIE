While working on something completely unrelated, Google security researcher, Tavis Ormandy, recently discovered that Cloudflare was leaking a wide range of sensitive information, which could have included everything from cookies and tokens, to credentials.
Cloudflare moved quickly to fix things, but their postmortem downplays the risk to customers, Ormandy said.
The problem on Cloudflare's side, which impacted big brands like Uber, Fitbit, 1Password, and OKCupid, was a memory leak.
The flaw resulted in the exposure of "HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data," Cloudflare said.
About an hour after being alerted by Ormandy, Cloudflare disabled three features on its platform; email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes and Automatic HTTPS Rewrites, as they were using the broken HTML parser chain determined to be the cause of the problem.
