Cybercriminals that specialize in ransomware, which affects thousands of computers and mobile devices every year, are ramping up their attacks against businesses.
It is here that they can get their hands on valuable information and large sums of cash.
This particular kind of malware, which hijacks devices and demands a ransom for their return, has managed to conquer another kind of technology: smart TVs.
Last December, the American developer Darren Cauthon announced on Twitter that a family member’s television had fallen victim to one of these attacks.
The television in question was an LG model that came out in 2014 that is compatible with Google TV, a version of Android tailored to televisions.
Once it had infiltrated the device, the malicious software demanded a ransom of $500 dollars to unlock the screen, which simulated a warning from the Department of Justice.

The appearance of the false message would lead you to believe that it’s a version of the ransomware known as Cyber.police, also known as FLocker.
Ordinarily this ransomware affects smartphones with Google’s operating system.
After hijacking the device, the malware collects information from the user and the system, including contact information and the location of the device, to be sent encrypted to cybercriminals.
