Between an industry-wide push to encrypt all web traffic and the newfound popularity of secure chat apps, it's been a boom time for online privacy.
Virtual private networks, which shield your web traffic from prying eyes, have rightly garnered more attention as well.
But before you use a VPN to hide your online shopping from the IT department at your company—or help protect yourself from state surveillance—know that not all mobile VPNs are created equal.
You can use VPNs to conceal the location revealed by your IP address; one common use before a recent crackdown was to access regional content, like US Netflix, from countries with lesser libraries.
Ideally, a VPN funnels all your traffic through an encrypted, secure, private network, making it more difficult for a third party to monitor your browsing than if your data were exposed on a public network.
It all sounds great, but isn't always so rosy in practice.
That's because using a VPN grants the company behind it extensive access to your data at the same time that it hides the stream from everyone else.
Even worse, malware masquerading as a VPN could do real damage by concealing malicious activity on your device behind a veneer of security protection.
"These days, many people know what a VPN is and what they can do with one," says Kevin Du, a computer security researcher at Syracuse University and an IEEE senior member.
"Not many people know what a bad or flawed VPN can do to their devices, because they don’t know how VPN works."
VPNs have been around for years, as have their attending trust issues.
But while previously VPN enthusiasts were mostly a core base of desktop users, the mobile boom and app-store accessibility have created an explosion in mobile VPN offerings.
