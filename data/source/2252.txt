A new variant of the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced on Monday, according to cyber security firm Check Point Software, which it said it had stopped from damaging computers by activating a "kill switch" in the software.
The company discovered the new variant at about 7am New York time on Monday, as it was infecting computers at a rate of about one per second, said Check Point researcher Maya Horowitz.
The firm responded by setting up a server that initiated what is called a kill switch built into the software, which prevents it from encrypting data on infected machines or spreading to other computers, she said.
Ransomware is illicit software that demands a "ransom" from an infected user to regain control of their computer.
