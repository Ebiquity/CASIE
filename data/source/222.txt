A security researcher that only goes by the nickname of Racco42 discovered the vulnerability on Thursday, January 12.
The issue affected only one Cerber server, not all, and was most likely due to a misconfiguration.
The server wasn't a command and control server, but a mere staging server from where the victims' computers would connect and download the actual ransomware, which would later run and infect their PCs.
An error in one of the server files (hxxp://truthforeyoue.top/search.php) displayed page source code, instead of executing it.
This information found its way to Avast security researcher Jaromir Horejsi, who together with the Avast team leveraged this error to get control over the server.
For a period of three hours, the Avast teams explains, they collected information from server logs.
The Avast team observed over 700 users download Cerber installers, which ran on their PCs.
Extrapolating this number to a whole day, just one typical Cerber ransomware staging server would be able to deliver payloads to around 8,400 users during a spam run peak or malvertising campaigns.
