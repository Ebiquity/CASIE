The site now includes a malicious link that infects the computers of anyone visiting, Arctos contends.
Palani Bala, Arctos' CTO, claims that  HPCL's  site was compromised by a series of attacks by the pseudo-Darkleech campaign, which exposes users to Nemucod malware that, in turn, downloads Cerber ransomware onto their machines.
Darkleech is a long-running campaign that uses exploit kits to deliver malware.
The executable downloaded logs delivered by exploit kits were analyzed through a behavior analysis engine, which identified the executable file as Cerber ransomware based on behavior classification, Bala says.

Bala claims the attackers run automated bots that look for vulnerable sites and then tamper with them by adding additional content that delivers malware to visitors' computers.
Experts say hackers using Cerber ransomware usually demand $1,000 in bitcoin from infected users.
Cerber ransomware and its encryption components are updated daily on the site, he adds.
First appearing in March 2016, Cerber often contains an audio file with a ransom message.
The ransomware largely spreads via spear-phishing campaigns, security experts say.
Arctos suspects the HPCL attackers' bot might have exploited vulnerabilities in an old Apache web-server or any additional services/plug-ins running in the server, Bala says.
He recommends that HPCL's webserver infrastructure perimeter be protected around the clock by advanced security monitoring solutions to detect such compromises.
In the meantime, it's time CERT-In made a recommendation to HPCL and others on how to avoid infections.
