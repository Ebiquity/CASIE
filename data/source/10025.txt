One of two Nigerians who admitted to being part of a conspiracy to steal personal information from Vermont state employees and other U.S. residents was sentenced. Tuesday in Rutland federal court to time served, or 14 months in jail. Osariemen Isibor, 32, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in March to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another man, Eneye Dania, 31, also pleaded guilty in March to being part of the same conspiracy. Last week, Dania was sentenced to serve 17 months in jail. Dania has been held in jail for about 14 months. While Isibor's prison sentence on the charge is complete and Dania's will be soon, neither is expected to be released. Instead, both are expected to be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement before being deported to Nigeria. According to court records, the goal of the conspiracy was “fooling United States residents … into sending the logon information they used to access their IRS form W-2 data from their employer's website to another website designed to look like their employer's human resources page but actually operated by the conspiracy to collect this data”. Once people entered their information into the fake website, the conspirators attempted to trick the IRS into sending tax refunds to the conspirators, but prosecutors said fraud detection controls put in place by the IRS “caused most, if not all, such fraudulent tax returns to be rejected”.
