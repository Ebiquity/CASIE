TSB is a mysterious group that appeared in the summer of 2016 when they dumped on GitHub and other sites a trove of files they claim to have stolen from the Equation Group, a codename given to a cyber-espionage group many cyber-security experts believe to be the NSA.
In their original announcement, the group dumped a collection of free files so that cyber-security experts can validate the veracity of their claims.
In addition, the group also released a second set of files, which were encrypted with a password the group promised to provide to the winner of online bidding war.
As no one stepped forward, the group started selling some of these tools individually last December but eventually called it quits in January, announcing their retirement just ahead of President Trump's inauguration.
Now, the group is back, and the reason why, according to a post published on their Medium blog, is because of Trump's political moves, which appear to have angered the group.
The reasons, as listed by the Shadow Brokers, are below, in original:
The politically-charged message ends with the password for the rest of the supposed NSA hacking tools they group released last summer.
The first cache of NSA hacking tools contained quite a lot of material, such as zero-day exploits and tools to bypass firewalls (Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, and TOPSEC), a toolkit to extract VPN keys, backdoors for Linux systems, and several Windows exploits.
This second cache is quite fresh, and security researchers haven't had the time to search it in its entirety.
