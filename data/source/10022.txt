CHESAPEAKE, Va. - An attack on computers at Grassfield High School has students and parents concerned. Chesapeake Public Schools says a malware attack is responsible for taking the school off the grid.
The school district said a virus entered their network through phishing emails sent to employees. Only a couple of divisions have been affected and it's not a system-wide outage. However, it impacted Grassfield High School in a big way. Classes heavily relying on technology were affected, but the others carried on as usual.
