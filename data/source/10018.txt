An anonymous computer hacker has demanded US$5000 from a provincial high school to return course work they are holding for ransom.
HƒÅwera High School staff in South Taranaki switched on their computers on Monday to discover a message demanding payment for the return of encrypted data on a server containing students' work and teaching resources, principal Rachel Williams said.
The hack did not affect student and staff records but the entire school network was taken offline as a precaution. 
The only devices being used at the school are running off their own data or a hotspot from a mobile phone, she said.Forensics experts from the police, Ministry of Education and the school's network provider were all working to find the source of the intrusion.
