Do you trust your Android VPN client to keep your data secure and your online browsing private?
The researchers have contacted the developers of the apps found sporting some or all of these issues, and some have reacted by fixing the vulnerabilities.
Most of them, though, did not respond, and some responded only to confirm the findings and to offer justification for the choices they make about how they operate the service.
