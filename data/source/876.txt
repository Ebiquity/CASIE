Warning the device is susceptible to denial of service attacks, Cisco Systems on Wednesday released a patch for its NetFlow Generation Appliance.
The flaw traces back to the hardware’s Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) used by the appliance, according to a Cisco Security Advisory posted Wednesday.
Cisco warns the vulnerability, “could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to hang or unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition”.
The bug (CVE-2017-3826) is due to incomplete validation of SCTP packets being monitored on the NGA data ports, Cisco wrote.
It impacts Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliances NGA 3140, NGA 3240 and NGA 3340.
NetFlow Generation Appliances are located within enterprise data centers and designed to monitor Gigabit Ethernet high-throughput networks.
An attacker exploiting the vulnerability, “could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SCTP packets on a network that is monitored by an NGA data port.
SCTP packets addressed to the IP address of the NGA itself will not trigger this vulnerability.
An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the appliance to become unresponsive or reload, causing a DoS condition,” Cisco said.
While there are no workarounds to fix the vulnerability, Cisco is urging users to apply an update that fixes the bug, Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliance Software release 1.1 (1a).
The company added that the fix does not apply to NGA 3140 because that platform was sunsetted January 11, 2014.
Last month, Cisco patched an authentication bypass vulnerability in its Cisco Prime Home hardware.
In January, Cisco patched a flaw rated critical found in is WebEx Chrome Plugin, used by tens of millions for web conferencing in business environments, that exposed computers to remote code execution.
Cisco Systems released a patch Monday to fix a critical security vulnerability, with a CVSS rating of 10, in its Secure Sockets Layer VPN solution called Adaptive Security Appliance.
