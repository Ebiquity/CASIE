Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence research arm, has uncovered evidence of links between attacks using two new malware families and two families of Google Android malware.
This has been discovered as part of work on preventing and detecting targeted attacks in the Middle East.
The attackers favour using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails.
A number of samples analysed were linked via the URL shortening service “bit.ly”.
The URL shortening service then redirects users to the malicious payload hosted on attacker controlled pages.
Another method favoured by the attackers was the setting up of fake news sites.
