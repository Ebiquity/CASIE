At last count, 110 organizations have reported successful Phishing attacks targeting W-2 records, placing more than 120,000 taxpayers at risk for identity fraud.
Many of those working for the victimized firms have had a stressful time dealing with the fallout.
Those who have experienced this unique type of crime say it's a nightmare.
Some of those affected have had fraudulent returns filed under their name, in addition to issues with educational expenses.
In one case, the scammers created flexible spending accounts with their stolen identities.
The Phishing attacks causing so much damage, also known as BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks, are simple and effective.
They exploit trust relationships within the office, and in many cases, exploit the routine practice of sharing data via email.
According to the IRS, these attacks are some of the most dangerous email scams the agency has seen in a long time.
"It can result in the large-scale theft of sensitive data that criminals can use to commit various crimes, including filing fraudulent tax returns.
We need everyoneâ€™s help to turn the tide against this scheme," IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, remarked in a warning issued last month.
In 2016, Databreaches.net tracked 145 BEC victims.
With more than five weeks left in the current tax season, the count sits at 110 (as of 03-13-17) and shows no signs of slowing.
As mentioned, those impacted by the BEC attacks have described the aftermath as a frustrating nightmare, one that drains them of time and in some cases money when their returns are delayed.
