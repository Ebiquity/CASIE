An effective new phishing attack is hitting Gmail users and tricking many into inputing their credentials into a fake login page.
The phishers start by compromising a Gmail account, then they rifle through the emails the user has recently received.
After finding one with an attachment, they create an image (screenshot) of it and include it in a reply to the sender.
They use the same or similar subject line for the email, to invoke recognition and automatic trust.
“You click on the image, expecting Gmail to give you a preview of the attachment.
Instead, a new tab opens up and you are prompted by Gmail to sign in again,” WordFence CEO Mark Maunder warns.
The phishing page is a good copy of Gmail’s login page, and its URL contains the accounts.google.com subdomain, which is enough to fool many into believing that they are on a legitimate Google page.
“This phishing technique uses something called a ‘data URI’ to include a complete file in the browser location bar.
When you glance up at the browser location bar and see ‘data:text/html…..’ that is actually a very long string of text,” Maunder explained.
