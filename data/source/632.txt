Columbia Sportswear Co, is investigating an attack on one of its e-commerce sites.
CEO Tim Boyle told analysts on Columbia’s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call that there was an unspecified cyber attack on its prAna brand’s online store.
Columbia Sportswear acquired prAna in May 2014 for $190 million in cash.
“We immediately launched an investigation and engaged a leading third-party cyber security firm to assist us,” he told analysts on the call, according to a transcript from Seeking Alpha.
“Protecting our customers’ information is one of our top priorities and we are taking this very seriously.
Until the investigation is completed, it’s difficult to characterize the scope or nature of the potential incident, but we are working vigilantly to address this issue”.
Boyle stressed that the attack was limited to prAna’s site and did not affect Columbia’s other online stores.
Online sales are growing fast for the outdoor apparel maker and retailer.
Boyle told analysts the company generated about $220 million in online sales globally in 2016.
