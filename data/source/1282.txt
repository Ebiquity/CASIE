Derek Bradley, head of Panacea, an online community of 17,000 financial services professionals, has warned that phishing emails have been sent out that are purporting to be from him.
Mr Bradley originally became a victim of a cyber attack back in September when his emails were compromised.
He warned that all emails received from him to undisclosed recipients over the past seven months were not sent from his system.
In a message sent out yesterday (22 March), he said: “We are in the process of trying to work out the best course of action to ensure this stops happening, but it is difficult as I have no control over what is being sent and by whom.
“I do apologise again for any inconvenience caused to you.
We will hopefully find a resolution to this issue as soon as possible”.
Mr Bradley also warned that the hackers are continuing to try and get access to other contact lists, and told advisers to ignore emails to undisclosed recipients.
The government is facing calls to create a single point of responsibility to deal with cyber risk in the financial services sector amid concerns over accountability.
Today (23 March) Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, wrote to chancellor Philip Hammond claiming a lack of coordination in the current cyber security system could leave the banking industry’s IT systems vulnerable to attack.
My Tyrie said the present arrangement, in which both a director-level group and a governance framework can serve as a single point to address cyber issues, resembles the "catastrophically inadequate" tripartite authorities that were set up to monitor system risk in banking in 1997.
