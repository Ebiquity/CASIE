A malvertising campaign is targeting iOS devices with a VPN that doesn't hide the fact it collects large quantities of users' information.
It also employs the aggressive tactic of playing a high-pitch beeping.
To help address the "issues" the site provides a link to a program called "My Mobile Secure."
"We have detected that your Mobile Safari is (45.4%) DAMAGED by BROWSER TROJAN VIRUSES picked up while surfing recent corrupted sites.
When someone clicks "Remove Virus," their device presents an installation prompt for a VPN called "My Mobile Secure."
My Mobile Secure is linked by users' emails to MobileXpression, a market firm which seeks to study web behavior by collecting users' information.
If the intent is to use a VPN to anonymize your online activities, this does almost the opposite."
It's reasonable to expect nothing more from a malvertising campaign.
With that said, users should take great care to not click on suspicious ads and should consider installing an ad-blocker in their web browsers.
They should also consider downloading a VPN, but they should make sure to research VPN providers and their privacy policies carefully before they choose a solution.
