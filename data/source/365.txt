Recently a hacker identified the existence of two high-risk bugs and revealed this information on Reddit’s forum posts.
The hacker, who uses the alias Cipher0007, managed to steal 200,000 private messages.
These messages were exchanged between users/buyers and sellers.
ZDNet reports that Cipher0007 disclosed the vulnerabilities earlier this week and revealed on Reddit that these flaws could be used to steal private messages on AlphaBay.
The messages weren’t protected by PGP keys, which made it easier for Cipher0007 to steal them in such large proportion.
Must Read: 
AlphaBay posted an official statement on Pastebin in which they admitted the presence of these bugs and also confirmed that Cipher0007 has hacked around 218,000 messages.
It must be noted that the hacked messages weren’t older than 30 days since the site’s system automatically purges messages that are more than 30 days old.
To prove that he has managed to infiltrate AlphaBay and stole private messages, Cipher0007 posted numerous screenshots too.
AlphaBay rewarded Cipher0007 for not selling the flaws or exposing the stolen data to the public.
Cipher0007 then disclosed the methods he used to exploit AlphaBay to the company and finally the developers at the trading platform managed to fix the flaws.
