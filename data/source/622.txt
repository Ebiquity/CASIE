The January attacks against Polish financial institutions through the booby-trapped site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority are just one piece of a larger puzzle, elements of which are slowly coming to light.
As the indicators of compromise and attack were shared by the affected banks, other institutions around the world found that they have been hit, as well.
The sites were booby-trapped with code that would trigger the download of malicious JavaScript files from other compromised domains (sap.misapor[.
The domains hosted an exploit kit, which leveraged Silverlight and Flash exploits to deliver malware.
According to the researchers’ findings, the site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority was booby-trapped since at least the beginning of October 2016, but not all visitors were hit.
The IPs only contained the first 3 octets, and would have been used to filter traffic such that only IPs on that subnet would be delivered the exploit and payload.
The IP addresses corresponded to a mix of public and private financial institutions spread across the globe,” BAE Systems researchers shared.
The majority of these institutions are banks in Poland, the US, Mexico, UK, and Chile.
