# CASIE : CyberAttack Sensing and Information Extraction

## Tool for extracting cyberattack event information 
Components of CASIE are written in Python:
1. nug\_arg_detection.py is for detecting nugget and argument.
2. realis_identify.py is for identifying realis for event nugget.
3. role_phrase.py is for assigning roles to arguments.
4. Others scripts are needed for running components.

## Annotation corpus of cybersecurity event in news articles
The corpus contains 1000 annotation and source files.
Our cybersecurity focused on five event types: Databreach, Phishing, Ransom, Discover, and Patch.

More details of the annotation and CASIE's system are in the papers. If you use our data, please cite one of the following papers.
