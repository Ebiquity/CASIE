# CASIE : CyberAttack Sensing and Information Extraction

## Tool for extracting cyberattack event information 
Components of CASIE are written in Python:
1. nug\_arg\_detection.py (applied Domain-Word2vec) or nug\_arg\_detection_bert.py (applied BERT) are for training the neural classifier to detect nugget and argument. 
2. realis_identify.py is for training the neural classifier to identify realis for event nugget.
3. role_phrase.py is for training the neural classifier to assign roles to arguments.
4. link_coref.py is for identifying realis and linking role using in the trained models and grouping the mentions of the coreference events.
5. Others scripts are needed for running CASIE's components.

## Annotation corpus of cybersecurity event in news articles
The corpus contains 1000 annotation and source files.
Our cybersecurity focused on five event types: Databreach, Phishing, Ransom, Discover, and Patch.

More details of the annotation and CASIE's system are in the papers. If you use our data, please cite one of the following papers.
